Kill JAY-Z, they'll never love you
You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, JAY-Z
Fuck JAY-Z, I mean, you shot your own brother
How can we know if we can trust JAY-Z?
And you know better, nigga, I know you do
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, you had the armor
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer
Die JAY-Z, this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi, JAY-Z
Cry JAY-Z, we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up, JAY-Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with JAY-Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him twenty million without blinkin'
He gave you twenty minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga, never go Eric Benét!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the future other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it
13 bottles of Ace of Spade, what it did to Boston
Nah, JAY-Z
Bye, JAY-Z",940.8K

Skin is, skin, is
Skin black, my skin is black
My, black, my skin is yellow

Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga
I like that second one
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga

[Interlude]
O.J. like, ""I'm not black, I'm O.J."" …okay

[Verse 1]
House nigga, don't fuck with me
I'm a field nigga, with shined cutlery
Gold-plated quarters, where the butlers be
I'ma play the corners where the hustlers be
I told him, ""Please don't die over the neighborhood
That your mama rentin'
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
That's how you rinse it""
I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin'
I coulda bought a place in DUMBO before it was DUMBO
For like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million
Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

[Chorus]
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga

You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit
You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it

[Verse 2]
Financial freedom my only hope
Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke
I bought some artwork for one million
Two years later, that shit worth two million
Few years later, that shit worth eight million
I can't wait to give this shit to my children
Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date
Y'all out here still takin' advances, huh?
Me and my niggas takin' real chances, uh
Y'all on the 'Gram holdin' money to your ear
There's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah

Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile, you recordin'?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends

Here's your friendly announcer

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

With that Eastside, that dance, uh

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & JAY-Z]
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem (Uh-huh, yeah)
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare (Yeah)
In my dreams, in my dreams (Ugh)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy had ""Slave"" on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't ""big bro"" me, don't ""Big Homie""
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams

[Post-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I've been out of touch for a couple years
I've been ready for this for real
Hopin' I can touch what I see
'Cause I've been ready for you, for real

Look, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome, you make it home""
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said: ""Don't embarrass me"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I apologize
Our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over; ""What if—""
""You over my shit?""

[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

I'm never gonna treat you like I should",1.8M

Let me alone, Becky

I missed the karma that came as a consequence

Daddy, what's a will?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Take those monies and spread 'cross families
My sisters, Hattie and Lou, the nephews, cousins and TT
Eric, the rest to B for whatever she wants to do
She might start an institute, she might put poor kids through school
My stake in Roc Nation should go to you
Leave a piece for your siblings to give to their children too
TIDAL, the champagne, D'USSÉ, I'd like to see
A nice peace-fund ideas from people who look like we
We gon' start a society within a society
That's major, just like the Negro League
There was a time America wouldn't let us ball
Those times are now back, just now called Afro-tech
Generational wealth, that's the key
My parents ain't have shit, so that shift started with me
My mom took her money, she bought me bonds
That was the sweetest thing of all time, uh

Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
Black excellence baby, you gon' let 'em see

And niggas like, ""Your seed married his seed, married my seed""
That's how we keep Carter money all in the family

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
You see, my father, son of a preacher man
Whose daughter couldn't escape the reach of the preacher's hand
That charge of energy set all the Carters back
It took all these years to get to zero in fact
I hated religion 'cause here was this Christian
He was preachin' on Sundays, versus how he was livin' Monday
Someday I forgive him
'Cause strangely our division led to multiple religions
I studied Muslim, Buddhist, and Christians
And I was runnin' from him, He was givin' me wisdom
See how the universe works?
It takes my hurt and help me find more of myself
It's a gift and a curse
That's called the Red Queen's Race

[Bridge: JAY-Z]
You run this hard just to stay in place
Keep up the pace, baby
Keep up the pace

Uh, letter to my dad that I never wrote
Speeches I prepared that I never spoke
Words on a paper that I never read
Proses never penned, they stayed in my head
Jotted on dotted lines, ""I'ma fight you, nigga""
From stories that I heard, I'm just like you, nigga
Must've been some pain in your past, too
Must've been a karma that was past due
Must it be the energy that passed through
Must've been a pastor, many snafus
Started a good man, you married my mama
I was in her belly, you hurried that Summer
She had two kids from a previous mister
One family, I don't believe in half-sisters
Never treated my brother like a step, Pop
Remembered the many lessons when we stepped out

[Chorus]
What was you preparing us—
For?

[Verse 2]
Did you see the runt as the front-runner
Leader of the pack, you see that in your youngins
What ancestors did you summon to the summit
To give me what I needed, what you need to take from 'em
The tsunamis that I swum in to become in
Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in
Unc in a better place but you couldn't function
Shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured
I punted on feelings, 'cause you said you was coming
You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said something
You can't avenge these many sins with your own hands
You wanna make God laugh, just tell him your plans
Who would've thought I'd be the dad I never had
Be the husband I've become, usually nothing come from that
I forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past
I'm just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap

Look at all we been through since last August
Skating through the rumors like, ""Aw, shit!""
Still came back, fucked up the red carpet

On the Run, we took a hundred together
More than the money, it was the fact that we done it together
Uh, healing in real time
Song Cry to Resentment, that was real crying
Bonnie and Clyde things, we hold it down
Had we surrendered then, that'd be the real crime
Got through it, got blessed times two with it
New Bel-Air estates with four pools in it
I told my bro, ""You gotta go home,"" over vino
Goodfella, don't gamble with your life, this ain't Casino
Cost him two mill' plus the child support
We'll get the money back, but not the child support
It's getting too late, we can't afford mistakes
Woulda broke me down had you got away
It woulda broke me up, you took my child away
I'm glad we found a way

Too perfect not to wonder (yeah)
If we created a flame that would warm us 'til it’s over
We invented lovers from company for the summer

Broken is better than new, that's kintsukuroi

New money, they looking down on me
Blue bloods they trying to clown on me
You can turn up your nose high society
Never gone turn down the homie

Straight cash I bought ya neighbor out
You should come to the housewarming
Come and see what your new neighbor 'bout (SKIRRRRR!)
Yellow Lambo in the driveway
A buck thirty-five, I'm on the highway
Frank Sinatra on my Sonos
Loud as fuck, I did it my way
A million sold before the album dropped
White Lexus before I had a deal
Ask Bun B about me
This ain't no snap back, a nigga been trill
By the way, fuck your mag
You ain't gotta count it my nigga I can add
1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 20 million
Oh, I'm so good at math
Might crash ya Internet
And I ain't even into that
When I was talking Instagram
Last thing you wanted was your picture snapped
Feds still lurking
They see I'm still putting work in
Cause somewhere in America
Miley Cyrus is still twerkin'

They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin' for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs

You in the presence of a king
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I escaped, a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras, you over baby
Robinson Cano, you coming with me
These niggas like rotary phones
It's a new day, hit up KD
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldn't let me in
I ball so hard on ESPN
See my name come across on CNN
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again

Bitch asked if I was God, fuck I'm supposed to say? No?
You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T
You already know what I could do with the coke
Dropped it in the water, made it disappear
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope
I make my roof get ghost, bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold
All the shit I did, I wasn't supposed to live, Hallelujah Hov
Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
Best friends become ya enemies, niggas' knives are double-edged

Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality

Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets

They can't believe this much skill is in the human body

Aw, fuck it, you got me

Question existence until them questions are solved

I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

“I work and work 'til I'm half-dead and I hear people saying
""She's getting old,"" and what do I get? A daughter
Who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her
As she cares about ME!”

[Verse 1]
Let's do this for these babies
Mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres
Blatantly ballin' on HD
Y'all need to step up y'all AV
Life changed again I was already taking off
My flight changed again
Slight change of winds
It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
Baby need Pampers
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely?
Now I'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody, I need a joint right now
Just the thought alone fucks with me

High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter

I dream filthy (My mom and pops)
Mixed me with Jamaican (Rum and whiskey, what a set off)
And I know I'm not perfect baby
I done been through so much trauma, it gonna be hard to reverse it
With some doctors and some nurses maybe
Teach me on how to treat a lady, open doors on the 'Cedes
This relationship shit is complicated
All I know if we ain't speaking everyday, I fucking hate it
I don't wanna duplicate it
I seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin' crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me
I got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me

Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no momma drama
I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared
But in life and death if I ain't here

Squirt obey your thirst, fashion lines
'tween beauty and beast, I walk the line
Johnny Cash, I'm a real G
I cut myself today to see if I still bleed
Success is so sublime
Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind
Something 'bout the struggle so divine
This sort of love is hard to define
When you scratching for every nickel and dime

I die for my niggas and I love my cub, hope that's not fucked up
I got a problem with the handouts, I took the man route
I'll give an opportunity though, that's the plan now
No guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out
No guilt in receiving, every thing within reason
Can't see it taking food out my little monster's mouth
That'll drive me gaga
Run up in your momma's house, two nickels, one dime
Manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down

Live In Brooklyn,Crazy In Love (Live In Brooklyn) by Beyoncé (Ft. JAY-Z) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Beyonce-crazy-in-love-live-in-brooklyn-lyrics,"[Interlude: JAY-Z]
Yea, history in the making
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
(Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my) pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I'm warmed up now, let's go
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh (Oh)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (Oh no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony Soprano (Oh, no)
The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, If anything I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
Crazy, bring ya whole set
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back Young, ever since I made the change over
To platinum, the game's been a wrap, one

[Verse 4: Beyoncé]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby
Hey!

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love",

Can I get some light in here?
Cellphones in the air

[Intro: Beyoncé]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the stars
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man (sing)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young (yes)
Do you really want to live forever?(ah)
Forever and ever (sing)
Forever young (young) I wanna be (yes)
Forever young young ah
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happened to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut we'll be fine, ah
(Sing)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Forever young young I wanna be
(Forever young) (yes)
Do you really want to live forever? yeah
Forever and on top ever
Forever young I wanna be
(Forever young) yeah, yeah
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever young

[Verse 2: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping out of Porsche's
Popping up on Forbes lists, gorgeous, hold up
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking more shit
I be talking more shit, I'm nauseous, hold up
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, baby, bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet I'm painting you a portrait

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Forever young
I wanna be forever young yeah, yeah
Do you really want to live forever?
And ever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever your time, sing!
(Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever)
One more time, sing!
(Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young)

[Jay-Z]
This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records

[Just Blaze]
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov!
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, OH—not D.O.C
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do it Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors (*laughing*)
This ain't a movie, dog (oh shit)

[Interlude: Just Blaze]
Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!
And I don't care WHAT you think about me—but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my ""by any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the God
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin'
""Fuck the other side! They're jealous!""
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in
‘Cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like millionaires' row

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels.""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels.""
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel

Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with mebitch
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]

[Intro]
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're far too kind

[Chorus]
Now, can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Chorus]
Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?

[Verse 2]
(*Sighs*) Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

[Interlude]
Owww, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage
Say ""Hova!"" – c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? [crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""]
C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!

[Break]
I like the way this one feel
It's so motherfuckin' soulful, man!
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay

[Verse 3]
So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this

[Intro]
""Ladies and gentlemen
Let's put our hands together for this dynasty!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
To the 8th wonder of the world!
The flow of the century, always timeless: HOV!
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me, I appreciate that, ah""

[Verse 1]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't-born-hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! —Vamoose, son of a bitch!

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let them know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk mo' bucks

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 3]
Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game: the two things that's great
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me

This is anti-Auto-Tune, death of the ringtone

This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct (uhh!)
This might offend my political connects (uhh!)
My raps don’t have melodies
This should make niggas wannna go and commit felonies (uhh!)
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn (Uhh!)

But the music y'all making gon' make it the Great Depression (uhh!)

This ain't a number one record (uhh!)
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon (uhh!)
I made this just for Flex and... Mister Cee
I want niggas to feel threatened (uhh!)
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light (That's too far, nigga!) (uhh, uhh!)
I might wear black for a year straight (uhh!)
I might bring back Versace shades (uhh!)
This ain’t for Z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 100 (uhh!)

You niggas singin' too much

I’m a multi-millionaire

"The Hits Collection, Vol. One",99 Problems Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-99-problems-lyrics,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

Yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos (Dinero!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley

Long live the king, yo—I'm from the Empire State, that's

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

In New York (Ayy, ow) (Uh, yeah)

You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin' greatest (Jigga)

Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off, nigga
I got you, yeah, uhh

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 1]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 2]
Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 3]
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off

Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 2]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

It's the hard knock life for us

Take your clothes off, you take off mine

It's big pimpin', spendin' Gs
Feel me uh-huh uhh, uh-huh
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese
Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We doin' big pimpin' up in NYC

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!

[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T

Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee

Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life

And out of the mercy of Allah and the law written in our nature
We call an individual into existence, and when that individual comes
I make no apologies for what I'm about to do...

[Verse: Jay-Z]
I'm America's worst nightmare
I'm young, black, and holdin' my nuts like ""Chyeah!""
Y'all was in the pub, having a light beer
I was at the club, having a fight there
Y'all can go home, husband and wife there
My mama at work tryna buy me the right gear
Nine years old, uncle lost his life here
I grew up thinking life ain't fair
How can I get a real job? China white right there
Right in front of my sight like, ""Here, yeah
There's your ticket out the ghetto—take flight right here
Sell me you go bye-bye here,"" damn!
There's a different set of rules we abide by here
You need a gun—niggas might drive by here
Y'all having fun, racing all your hotrods there
Downloading all our music on your iPods there
I'm Chuck D, standing in the crosshairs here
Y'all straight, chicks got horse hair here
Y'all ain't gotta be in fear of y'all bosses there
You lose your job, your pop rich, y'all don't care
So I don't care, y'all acting like y'all don't hear
All the screams from the ghetto, all the teens ducking metal here
So they steam like a kettle here
Tryna take they mind to a whole different level here
Yeah, we real close to devil here
Gotta be a better way; somebody call a reverend here
Yeah, y'all must really be in heaven there
Somebody tell God that we got a couple questions here
My lil' cuz never got to see his seventh year
And I'm so used to pain that I ain't even shed a tear
Yeah

Even worse, you a Pervis Ellis
You worthless, fella; you ain't no athlete, you Shawn Bradley

And I ain’t letting up, YUP!

And I don't write this, I just mic this, I will it to happen
One-take Hov, I’m real at this rapping
My new name is Just the Facts
While the rest of y'all just adjust the facts
Put words together, just to match
I say what I feel, y’all adjust to that
I do the opposite of y’all so I just attract
The realer audience usually unjustly Black
Know my flow and the shit they go through just match
Like the sound of my voice and a choice Just track
I just tackle the subject, the flak from the public is nothing
I know real niggas happen to love it
If you don’t like it, then look in the mirror
Most likely you ain’t live it so you don’t get it
You ain’t did it, so you can't vision, the picture I’m painting
Ain't vivid, the language I’m spitting is so foreign to ya

My president is black, in fact he's half-white
So even in a racist mind he's half right
If you have racist mind you'll be a'ight
My President is black, but his house is all white
Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk
Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run
Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly
So I'ma spread my wings, you can meet me in the sky
I already got my own clothes, already got my own shoes
I was hot before Barack, imagine what I'm gonna do
Hello Miss America, hey pretty lady
Red, white, and blue flag, wave for me, baby
Never thought I'd say this shit, baby, I'm good
You can keep your puss, I don't want no more Bush
No more war, no more Iraq
No more white lies, the president is black

Good morning, America, sorry I woke ya
I just had to say what's on my mind, like Oprah
Got the whole world like wide open, his mouth
Same reason during Katrina that he opened his house
Helped raise food, helped raise water so
God knows who can feed their son or their daughter
Say what I wanna say cause I'ma say, say it
Say what I'm gonna say cause I'm a taxpayer
Bill O'Reilly, eat a dick, nice try
You're really being a racist asshole in a nice tie
And tell Dennis Miller his show suck anyway
And I rather watch Jimmy Kimmel any day
I got some white friends and a white Benz
Parked out front and, yeah, also white rims
'Cept my president is black and I'ma be heard
Don't ever try to tell me now I can't say the b word

I'm up out M-a-r-c-y P-r-o-j-e-c-t
Ain't no other motherfucker in the rap game harder than me
I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top
I'm OnStar for new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'ma hundred million dollar movie, hand on my cock
Big Homie from the back block
When you first learned how to slap box
Then you even learned how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back, rock
Number one rule: if your ass get popped
Don't chatterbox to the Matlocks
Death before dishonor, I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude, but...
Yup! Fuck you, pay me!
I drown my pain in Porsches, I lost my partner to the bullshit
Still tryna hold on to my religion so
I put a couple diamonds in the crosses
Close your eyes, see the darkness
That's what it's like where I'm from
No lawyers no doctors
So either I go the hardest or I could just call this a night
On dark nights, it's like I see better
On Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger
Even if I overdose on drugs, motherfuckers can't kill my buzz
Wait, I ain't done; I'ma freestyle this, Khaled let it run
What's the hardest county in the Yayo?
'Cause I'ma go harder then they go
I'ma go harder than Baltimore
Philly gon' say they can't touch the boy
Where you at Duval? I'ma go harder than you all
Harder than New York, turn the Pro Tools in the booth off
I'ma go harder than Ye go
And Ye go hard; that's baby bro
Put some more beat on that joint

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm gunna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Gon head spit that murder I wrote
Man I dont care what what you felt
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of me, she gon go down
Maybe I would've slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin old but its good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be numba one
I guess its gon be what its gon be
But heres one thing ya'll got to hear

[Verse 1]
I ride through the ghetto windows down halfway
Halfway out of my mind music on 9, blasting Donny Hathaway
Me and my niggas spending half the day
Plotting, how we gon' get this math today without getting blast away
I wake up to the same problems after today
Life is harsh, nigga got a right to spark
Right from the start, they place me in the ghetto, tender age of nine
My tender mind had to surrender to crime
Wouldn't wish this on nobody life to end up like mine
Ever since I was quite young a nigga been in a bind
Had to scratch for every plaque, even rap ain't even all it's cracked up to be
Niggas don't stack up to me
Had to hustle in a world of trouble
Trapped in, claustrophobic, the only way out was rapping
America don't understand it, the demographics I tapped in
I'm the truest nigga to do this, nigga, and anything else is foolish
Like those who stay high, under God's grey skies
My lyrics is like Bible, made to save lives
In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly
Never let em see you frown, even smile when you down
Shit, I floss on my off-days, fuck what they all say
Niggas can't stop me with rumors, I'm too strong
All day, socks explode and sweatpants pockets is bulging
Holdin' it down on the corner with my block frozen
My spot is rolling, drop the price on the coke and
Drove the competition out and let the dough flow in
The cops is closing in, I can do the time
But what's really on my mind, there ain't no hoes in the pen
I play the low and try and make it hard to find me
Feds still tryna build a case since '93
I told them I'm retired, but they like whatever
You know them pigs don't wanna see you get your life together

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in this life forever
The more things change the more they stay the same
Who am I to change the game?
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
The block's hotter than its ever been
(Once again)

[Verse 2]
Hold the gun at eye level, I ain't afraid of conflict
I let the nine rip, nigga say ""hi"" to the devil
I blind with the bezel, I'm in line with the ghetto
What y'all niggas afraid of, my mind or the metal?
Niggas tryna subtract my life, my mathematics is precise
I carry the 9, so fucking with me just ain't the answer
I just can't lose when I was young I was like Fresh
Poppa raised me to chess moves
And though you're gone, I'm not bitter, you left me prepared
We got divided by the years, but I got it from here
Don't sweat that, sounds bump from Marcy to LeFrak
To that project in DC where my man caught his death at
Over my years I've seen Rooks get tooken by the Knight
Lose they Crown by tryna defend a Queen
Checkmate in 4 moves, the Bobby Fischer of rap with raw moves
In a time where we all move
Let's face it: either you're dough chasing or basing
Lacing, crack's got you feelin' strong like Mason
Careful, any infiltration, I'm leaving niggas
Leaking more than just information

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in this life forever
The more things change the more they stay the same
Who am I to change the game?
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
The block's hotter than its ever been
I'm stuck in this life forever
The more things change the more they stay the same

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
What we talkin' 'bout? Real shit or we talkin' 'bout rhymes?
You talkin' 'bout millions or you talkin' 'bout mine?
What we talkin' 'bout? 'Cause I ain't got time
For what people be talkin' 'bout all the time
What we talkin' 'bout? Fiction or we talkin' 'bout fact?
You talkin' 'bout fiction? Hold up, pardon my back
I'm talkin' 'bout life (Life, life)
And all I hear is, ""Oh yeah, he keeps talkin' 'bout crack""
I ain't talkin' 'bout profit, I'm talkin' 'bout pain
I'm talkin' 'bout despair, I'm talkin' 'bout shame
I ain't talkin' 'bout gossip, I ain't talkin' 'bout Game
I ain't talkin' 'bout Jimmy, I ain't talkin' 'bout Dame
I'm talkin' 'bout real shit, them people playin'
What is you talkin' 'bout? I don't know what y'all sayin'
People keep talkin' 'bout, ""Hov, take it back!""
I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothin' cool 'bout carryin' a strap
'Bout worryin' your moms and buryin' your best cat
I'm talkin' 'bout revenge while carryin' his casket
All teary-eyed, 'bout to take it to a mattress
I'm talkin' 'bout music, I ain't talkin' 'bout rap
You talkin' 'bout who's hot, I ain't talkin' 'bout that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map

They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
I see what y'all talkin' about, ha ha

Chyeah, still they can't focus on them, they be talkin' 'bout me
Talkin' 'bout what I wear, talkin' 'bout where I be
Yeah, check out my hair, these ain't curls, these is peas
Peasey head still get paid, I'm combin' through G's
Please, we ain't focused on naps
'Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map
A small part of the reason the President is black
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
Talkin' 'bout progress, I ain't lookin' back
You know I run track, try not to get lapped
People keep talkin' 'bout Hov left 'em flat
Tryna rewrite history, let's talk about facts
Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps
He could've made more but he ain't sign his contract
As far as street guys, we was dealin' crack
That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack
Grown men, want me to sit 'em on my lap
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
I repeat, you can't sit on my lap
I don't have a beard, now get off my sack—scream at me!

They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?

Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines

[Verse 1]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, please hold your applause
For I just applied logic—keys, keys open doors
Now I'm balcony, opera, black tux, binocular
Black Luxe, stop it, I shouldn't be so popular
Name keep poppin' up, face keep poppin' up
On the tube, I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up
How would I know HBO would get a shot of us?
Sittin' so close that we almost got snot on us
Please don't bow in my presence—how am I a legend?
I just got ten #1 albums, maybe now eleven?
More hits than a Now 11; that is no reason
To treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes
Thank God, what a guy, as I say my grace!
Who woulda thought by makin' birds migrate for the winter
I be fly all summer? Might I say

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

Hovi baby, we are really high, really high tonight
We tip the waiter a hundred dollars to keep the ice cold, alright
We the last ones to keep the wise guys code alive
If I can't live by my word, then I'd much rather die
No no, don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched
I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits

Beautiful women sippin' through rouge lips, eh
Dangers approaches, we're like: ""Wait, who's this?""
Let us save you some trouble, son, what size suit you is?
This way after the Ruger shoots through a few clips
You can lay in your casket just as you is
We appreciate the target practices
We'll be sure to send flower baskets, kid

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Verse 3]
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
I was gon' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales
I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help
And they did a good job, them boys is talented as hell
'Cause not only did they brick, they put a building up as well
Then ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar, then took a smell
'Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills
Niggas thought they was ill, found out they was ILL
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

We are really high, really really high, no
Really really high, really high tonight, ha

We are really high, really high tonight

Wrong, this ain't politically correct (uhh!)
This might offend my political connects (uhh!)
My raps don’t have melodies
This should make niggas wannna go and commit felonies (uhh!)
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn (Uhh!)
I know we facing a recession
But the music y'all making gon' make it the Great Depression (uhh!)
All your lack of aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set, men (uhh, uhh!)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence

This is practically assault with a deadly weapon (uhh!)
I made this just for Flex and... Mister Cee

Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light (That's too far, nigga!) (uhh, uhh!)
I might wear black for a year straight (uhh!)
I might bring back Versace shades (uhh!)
This ain’t for Z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 100 (uhh!)

You niggas singin' too much

I’m a multi-millionaire

[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

Microphone fiend, this the return of the God
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher

On the table, screamin'
""Fuck the other side! They're jealous!""
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in
‘Cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like millionaires' row

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care

Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels.""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels.""
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel

Yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos (Dinero!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (Ayy, aha) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Yeah) (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Aha, aha, aha) (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (New)
Big lights will inspire you (Come on) (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (You welcome, OG) (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh) (I made you hot, nigga)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
Labor Day Parade—rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo—I'm from the Empire State, that's

In New York (Ayy) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (Ayy, ow) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)

One hand in the air for the big city (Oh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Oh)
No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
""Yeah, yeah"" (Come on, come on)
""Yeah, yeah"" (Come on)

In New York (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)

Yeah, see it's that
It's that Blueprint 3 shit right here
It's that TM 103 shit right here
You ready? You ready Hov'?
Let's go! (Hands up!)

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
At the same time re-introduce my wealth
At the same time rejuvenate the game
It's for my old dawg niggas that's used to 'caine
Now what my B-dog said? I respect the game
GD's, Vice Lords, the Crips the same
And I know y'all 'bout to say this off the chain
Tell 'em fake trappin' ass niggas stay out my lane
See I ain't dead or in jail, I can't complain
And when these fake niggas gone, I shall remain
And if you just tunin' in, let me explain
You know I keep that 47, Uday Hussein
These niggas way too far, I played the game
And if you listen hard enough, I say some things
And when that sack got low, I shave them things
And put 'em right back together, I made them things

[Chorus: Jeezy & Jay-Z]
Now put your sets in the air if you represent your clique
Money in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby
Put your hands in the air if you know that you that bitch
Say you looking for the real? Hey, well this is real as it gets
Hey, hey, ohh, ohh (Wassup, wassup)
Hey, hey, ohh, ohh (Wassup, wassup, this is real as it gets)
Hey, hey, ohh, ohh (Wassup, wassup)
Hey, hey, ohh, ohh (I got it Jeezy, this is real as it gets)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Now where that Southside at? Wassup, wassup
Where the West Coast at? Put your W's up
Where my East Coast niggas that hustle to live
And all my niggas up north that's doin' a bid?
Oh yeah I'm rare, I'm aware that I'm rare
I rap and I’m real, I'm one of the few here
These other boys lyin', I wonder if y'all care
They stories out this world, I wonder if y'all hear
But don't really matter as long as they stay clear
Clear of the real shit we doin' over here
When my nigga get home, I'm gon' send him a Lear
For all the time he been down, get him right up in the air
With a couple of broads, get him right up in the air
Mile high club, get him right up in there
Send my nigga some gear like he never missed a year
By the time you hear this song, he'll be standin' right here
Real nigga shit there

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Now put your sets in the air if you represent your clique
Money in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby
Put your hands in the air if you know that you that bitch
Say you lookin' for the real? Hey, well this is real as it gets
Hey, hey, ohh, ohh
Hey, hey, ohh, ohh (This is real as it gets)
Hey, hey, ohh, ohh
Hey, hey, ohh, ohh (This is real as it gets)

A hundred million to the good and I'm still talkin' yayo
At a snail's pace, I won this race that y’all trail
Uh, uh, Blueprint's for sale
Followin' my footprints you can't fail
Set sail, I used to duck shots but now I eat quail
I'll probably never see jail
Each tale contains more of the truth
Of the statute allows me to go into detail
Uh, close your eyes, you can smell
Hov's the audio equivalent of braille
That's why they feel me in the favelas in Brazil
And Waterhouse 'cause real recognize real
Rrrah!

[Verse 4: Jeezy]
You know me, I don't need no introductions
Call me, make a lil' somethin' out of nothin'
Anywhere you go, we the topic of discussion
Damn, that's gotta be disgusting
Ugh, shit make you wanna throw up
This is big boy music, this should make you wanna grow up
Flows like syrup, it just make me wanna pour up
And is it just me or this makes you wanna roll up
A big fat one, then unpack one
Then unwrap one, peel back one
They use to call me Jizzle with the stamp in the middle
And you can tell the color when it's damp in the middle
Wassup!

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Now put your sets in the air if you represent your clique
Money in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby
Put your hands in the air if you know that you that bitch
Say you lookin' for the real? Hey, well this is real as it gets

If he keep going, pass the torch to him
50 came through like hurricanes do
I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did ""A Milli,"" 50 did a milli
'Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on ""Renegade,"" fucking awesome
Applaud him!

Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down
The Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake's up next, see what he do with it
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y’all remind me of us in early '92
Outkast landed, 3-thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ovay, ayyy

And I am one of one
Can’t you see just how long my run?
My reign, Lulu's son-shine
Been a star since I was duckin' one-time
One time, give it up for him
December 4th, a star was born
Clap for him! He went from moving that corner
To this corner office, it's so enormous
Hey, Prez Carter
Watch them get they Monica on all day
Hey, got so many different monikers but only one Jay
They come, they go, some real, some faux
Some friends, some hoes
But, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov'

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real lifesaver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now, cop a little ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick, thought he wrote the rap for him—no, sir!
The flow cold as the shoulders
Of gold-digging hoes when a broke nigga 'proaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in, and clap for 'em!

[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams, Jay-Z, & J. Cole]

If Hov's a Blackberry Bold, shorty is a Sidekick
She used to have a man, I used to have a side chick
Shorty got wind, I had to blow the chick off
She got rid of him, they both took the shit hard
Shorty played the piano, me I played with white keys
Shorty from the South, oh I think she like me
Shorty like Pac, me, Big Poppa
She screaming ""Hit Em Up,"" I'm screaming ""Who Shot Ya?""
I'm on that red wine, shorty like white
Same shit, different toilet, we both getting nice
Me I'm from the Apple, which means I'm a Mac
She's a PC, she lives in my lap

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Whether black or white, we both like Mike
We both like Jordans, we both Phil's Knight
I finish my breakfast, shorty's out to lunch
Yeah we both eating, it's better than brunch
Shorty like Pepsi, me I'm the coke man
Body like a Coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can
Started at the window, end up at the wall
The Yin to my Yang, I skeet skeet off
In a salt and pepper 'Bach, shorty like to front
The Bonnie to my Clyde, both riding shotgun
Both covered in gold like C3P0
James and Florida Evans, let the good times roll

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Thought shorty was the truth, found out she was a cheater
We were supposed to take over, I caught her bumping ""Ether""
I thought shorty liked Mike, found out she liked Prince
Thought she was Adrian, it's been rocky ever since
My dollars was down, she left me for some Euros
Took my whole flavor, I call her Coke Zero
We were co-MVP's like Kobe and Shaq
Left me for the Heat, we were winning back to back
Said I party too much, shorty got fed up
Shorty got Britney, shaved her whole head up
We used to make out, kissing each other's face off
Fell for the Ponzi scheme, damn shorty just made off

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard

Both are American Gangsters
You choose who's colder
Rappers get nasty in the booth but I'm grosser
I can’t even stomach myself, ulcer!
More realer 'cause I'm closer
Had girlies in girdles weighing more than they supposed to
Poser, no sir
My hustle, so Russell
I stretch work, yoga
You know I got it down, dog
Al Roker, I used to knock pounds off
It ain’t nothing for me to knock nouns off
At these MCs praying for my downfall
They just haters
I wave at you, I’m so player
I’ll never be done, I’m so ra-re

While I fly daily like I'm in the Air Force?
Therefore, please stop talking my ears off

Need to get its motherfucking weight up
Hold up, wait up, I ain’t done
Name one thing I ain’t done
It hurts when you say that I ain't the one
You haters, how do I gain your favor?
I need to know 'cause I care
I need you to love me, I swear, look here!

Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head
Not sure if that's how adults should speak to kids

I pop my demo tape in start to beat my head
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his
He might as well say beat it kid, he's on the list
It's like I'm searching for kicks like a sneaker head
He gon' keep pushing me until I reach the ledge
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell 'em all to eat a dick

Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine

""Man I worked for one of the biggest companies in New York City
He didn't own his own company
White man owned it, so they owned him
Nobody owns me though.""

[Idris Elba (Angel Wood)]
(Your gangster is not defined)
Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist, but more how your genes stand up to their expectations
""Never forgetting where we came from.""
(Your gangster, your gangster)
Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch
But rather how many rocks you move while owning watch
(Gangsters, hustlers, republicans, democrats, pimps and hoes)
Conservatives, labour
The seller, the buyer, the product, the producer
""See you are what you are in this world.""
The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern the gangsterment
(Gangsterment, gangsterment)
Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws
And create brand new words, gangster mentality
(Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white
Mastered by the black, and absorbed by the fiends
Taxed by the governmentality, governmentality (governmentality)
Charted by Forbes, if you believe in JAY-Z
Then you too can be a gangster) then you too can be a gangster
By any means necessary, by owning that dream
I mean it's a long walk to freedom
But, while deep, deep, deep inside the bush
(The war on terror screams, damn it feels good)
Damn it feels good to be a gangster, haha
(To be a gangster, swagger is not a must, it's a liability
A cliché, a bad suit, cut the bullshit
You know if it wasn't for this, there would be no that)

Look.. mind state of a gangster from the 40s
Meets the business mind of Motown's Berry Gordy
Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry my jewelry's so gaudy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauris
America, meet the gangster Shawn Corey
Hey young world, wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes and you can pretend you're me
I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedies
Frank Sinatra, having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence
As the incense burn and the turntables turn
And that Al Green plays
I see my mother's afro
As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's
And my papa just left the house
In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm her nerves
As I observe this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store
We can never be sure, so all we can do is... pray

[Break: Beyoncé]
Because of your strength
While I walked upon thee
For God is my defense (pray for me!)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
As I head to my homeroom
I observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground
I hear a car go, ""Vroom""
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle
I ask, ""Why you laugh?"", they say, ""You're too little
One day you'll understand when you become a man
About things you have to get you""
Fast forward, freeze frame on my pistol
Fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
Around here it's the shit that you just do
I just left school
The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had their guns drawn, screaming, ""Just move!""
""Or is there something else you suggest we can do?""
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like, ""Huh?""
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we called corrupt, he calls paying dues
Now when the rules is blurred
As they is and were, what am I to do?
But pray? Pray the Lord forgive me
Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through, pray

[Break: Beyoncé]
Deliver me in thy righteousness
And cause me to escape
And climb thine air unto me
Save me thine Lord (pray for me!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Geah.. anywhere there's oppression
And the drug profession
Flourishes like beverages, refreshing (ahhh!)
Sweet taste of sin
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg
What came first? Moving chickens or the egg?
This is why I be so fresh
I'm trying to beat life 'cause I can't cheat death
Treat shame with shamelessness
Aim stainlesses at anuses, you know the game this is?
Move coke like Pepsi
Don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
I'm not an angel, I'm sure, but every night before I lay
I drop my knees to the floor and I pray

[Outro: Beyoncé]
The name shall endure forever
The name shall be continued as long as the sun (pray for me!)
Men shall be blessed in Him
All nations shall call Him blessed
In your name I pray... (pray for me!)
Lord bless us",85.4K
American Gangster,American Dreamin' Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-american-dreamin-lyrics,"[Intro: Marvin Gaye]
Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all baby
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never, felt that before
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never, felt that before
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never, felt that before
But there's always; that's all, that's all baby

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uhh, uhh!
This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Bimmers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye sample (Jay-Z)]
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
(I'm just American dreamin')
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
But there's always, that's all, that's all baby

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Uh, uhhhh!
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
It's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No!
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, it's all in the stars
Like Tony La Russa on how you play your Cards
'Cause y'all ain't fucking with me! The ironies are
At all costs better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye sample (Jay-Z)]
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
(I'm just American dreamin')
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
But there's always, that's all, that's all baby

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Step one in this process: scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince them that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow 'cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time
I'm, American dreamin'

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye sample (Jay-Z)]
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before

Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way

Hello!
Brooklyn!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Jay-Z]
Hello, Brooklyn (Uh-huh), how you doing? (Yeah)
Where you going? Can I come too? (Uh-huh)
And If I can (Woo!), I'ma be your man
You could be my lady, and have my baby
And drive my cars (Cars), and drive me crazy (So crazy)
Wherever you going (Where you going?), baby girl, just take me (Uh-huh)
'Cause I'm so taken, if you taken (I'm so taken)
I'm just saying (Woo!), baby, I'm just saying

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Like a mama, you birth me; Brooklyn, you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley
They said you'd murk me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello, Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'ma call her? Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you
'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much, I bought extra
So much so that dinner's now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Lil Wayne & Jay-Z]
Hello, Brooklyn, how you doing?
Where you going? Can I come too?
And If I can, I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my cars, and drive me crazy
Wherever you going, baby girl, just take me
'Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying, baby, I'm just saying

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Hello, Brooklyn, what's your story?
She said she eating on the run, but she ain't Nore'
She said she got a man but he ain't worried
But baby, I'ma have to rob him like Horry
She said she love B.I.G., and she like 2Pac
And when I said Jay-Z, she say, ""It's the Roc!""
And I'ma leave it like this—like this, like that
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Have you seen her?
And when she tell you something, you better believe her
She told me she like my New Orleans demeanor
And so, I said, ""Goodbye, Katrina""

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Jay-Z]
And ""Hello, Brooklyn!"" Buh-baby, you are
The sweetest sight eyes could see
I said, ""Hello, Brooklyn!"" Buh-baby
I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said, ""Hello, Brooklyn!"" Buh-buh-baby, you are (Woo!)
So damn fine to me
And I remember the time (Time), place (Place)
And the weather (And, woo!)
On the day you said, ""Hi,"" to me
And I say, ""Hello, Brooklyn!""

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Brooklyn, you crazy; look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth, walking 'round, behaving—
All demented; black hoodies and Timberland-ed
Always scheming—""You see the gleam on that nigga's pendant?""
(Hello, Brooklyn) You bad influence, look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you (Haha), look at my attitude
It says my life's too real, check out my ice grill
Baby, I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville
But my Bed's in the Stuy, though I'll lie flat in your bush
'Til we smoke a C.I., ""What up"" to the boy, B.I.?
You know I handle B-I, I don't half-step on the 'caine
Ask the dreads 'bout I, how you gwaan 'so?
She like it hardcore, so I grind slow
Iller than Albee Square Mall back in the 9-0
My fine ho, we got some victims to catch
So in a couple years, baby, I'ma bring you some Nets (Woo!)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hello, Brooklyn, how you doing? (Yeah)
Where you going? Can I come too?
And If I can, I'ma be your man
You could be my lady, and have my baby
And drive my cars (Errr!), and drive me crazy (Errr!)
Wherever you goin' baby girl, just take me
'Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying, baby, I'm just saying (Yeah)

Hello, Brooklyn

American Gangster,No Hook Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-no-hook-lyrics,"[Produced by Sean C, LV, Diddy]

[Intro: Denzel Washington from American Gangster]
Most important thing in business is honesty, integrity
Hard work, family
Never forgetting where we came from

[Verse 1]
Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back
Liver bad, he wouldn't live long, that snatched my dad back
Guidance? I never had that, streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all
Burned it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at
Flash back, not having much, not having that
Had to get some challah bread so you can holla back and
Holla at my Jewish lawyer to enjoy the fruit of letting my cash stack
And just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Own boss, own your masters, slaves
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon' feed we?
If I need it, I'ma get it however, God help me

[Hook]
And I don't need no hook for this shiiiit

[Verse 2]
I'm so fa sho', it's no facade
""Stay outta trouble"", momma said as momma sighed
Her fear: her youngest son be a victim of homicide
But I gotta get you outta here momma, or I'ma, die ...inside
And either way, you lose me momma so let loose of me
I got the rein our direction will soon change
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game
Hustle 'caine, hustle clothes, I hustle music
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick
Skinny nigga, toothpick, but, but I do lift
Weight like I'm using 'roids
Rolls-Royce keep my movements, smooth while maneuvering
Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in
Choices, we make trying to escape, shit

[Hook]
And I don't need no hook for this shiiiit

[Verse 3]
This is not for commercial usage
Please don't categorize this as music
Please don't compare me to other rappers
Compare me to trappers, I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Luda's my dude, I ain't trying to diss
Like Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch
I'ma follow the rules no matter how much time I'ma get
I'ma live and die with the decisions that I'ma pick
So fuck DeHaven for caving, that's why we don't speak
Made men ain't supposed to make statements
End of the story, I followed the code, cracked the safe
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate
Leave that boy Hov' alone, why don't cha?
You don't have to if you don't want to
But don't say I didn't warn ya

Oh... and I don't need no hook for this shiiiit",106.9K

First of all, I wanna thank my connect
The most important person, with all due respect
Thanks to the duffle bag, the brown paper bag
The Nike shoe box for holding all this cash (Okay!)
Boys in blue who put greed before the badge (Okay!)
The first pusher who ever made the stash (Okay!)
The Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!)
Oh, what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!)
Thanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim
Thanks to a little change, I tore you out the game
Bullet wounds will stop your buffoonery
Thanks to the pastor, rapping at your eulogy
To Lil' Kim and them, you know the women-friend who
Carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers
And most importantly you: the customer

Let ya hair down baby, I just hit a score
Pick any place on the planet, pick a shore
Take what the Forbes figured, then figure more
'Cause they forgot to account what I did with the raw
Pick a time, let's pick apart some stores
Pick a weekend for freaking for figure fours
I figure frauds never hit a lick before
So they don't know the feeling when them things get across
Put ya hand out the window, feel the force
Feel the Porsche, hit defrost
Ice-cold, jewels got no flaws
Drop got no top, you on the top floor
Pink Rosé, think OJ
I get away with murder when I sling yay
Her-on got less steps than Britney
That means it ain't stepped on, dig me?

Rare Porsches, rare portraits
Rare guns if you dare come near the fortress
This apple sauce is from the apple orchard
This kinda talk is only reserved for the bosses
Which means I get it from the ground
Which means you get it when I'm around
Rich niggas, black Bar Mitzvahs
Mazel tov, it's a celebration bitches!

Cheers, toast to crime

American Gangster,Sweet Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-sweet-lyrics,"[Produced by Diddy, Sean C & LV]

[Verse 1]
Sweeeet... and still there's pain (pain, pain, pain...)
If I would have grew up to be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same (same, same...)
But since I grew up through the game
And my influence is the same
And my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed (ashamed...)
And though I wish I could separate the two things
I cannot so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearing the coast up
Tight coupes like I'm wearing the roadster
For any coupe, bear-hugging the holster

[Chorus]
Hov', alright al-right
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
Once again it's the life

[Verse 2]
So I make no apologies, crooked policies
So a G a nigga gotta be
We playing for property, no Monopoly
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me
They say the child shall lead
So I take it far as I can and then we shall see
Shall we dance with the devil for a beat
I pray to God I ain't got two left feet
Do the hustle put keys in the street
Then I'm ballroom dancing
Ke-ke'in in the suite
Sweet, BB's on the feet
TV's in the seat, ene-mies on the creep
It's so corrupt
Soak it up, it's a lesson, every fuck up
One day you're up
Next day you're down
Long as you stay the same it'll come back around

[Chorus]
Hov', alright al-right
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)
The life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
Once again it's the life

[Verse 3]
I'm even better
I'm eating better
Best thing about it is
My niggas eating together
With each endeavor, we reaching levels
Niggas ain't seen in like forever
I'm Hyman Roth, so made all my partners rich
I can't vouch for you
If you ain't a part of this
So pardon me as I pave my wrist, uh
As I parlay my chips
Hov', alright al-right
American gangster, gangster
Businesses like I'm white
But I'm not, I'm just bright
So fly with no fear of the flight, uhh
So if y'all hear my plight
And if you think you can make it this far without a fight
Couple mistakes here and there
Not always right, but I'm always real
That's how I sleep at night

Hov', alright al-right
And it may not be what you call perfect, but
But it's my life (uh)

Brushing off my three-piece, I make this look too easy
So tall and lanky, my suit, it should thank me
I make it look good to be this hood, Meyer Lansky
Mixed with Lucky Lefty, gangster effortlessly
Papa was a rolling stone, it's in my an-ces-try

Taking G-strolls through the ghee-tto

American Gangster,Ignorant Shit (Ft. Beanie Sigel) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-ignorant-shit-lyrics,"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Uhh, uhh, yes sir!
Just the sound of his voice is a hit, heh heh
Y'all niggas got me really confused out there
I make Big Pimpin' or Give It 2 Me one of those
Y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought provokin' shit
Y'all question whether he fallin' off?
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one... follow!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
""That's him!"", I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount
'Cause I been doin' this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada
Baggin' up at the Ramada, table full of powder
A/C broke, 'bout to take another shower on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the fight
You might see me anywhere, a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch get off me
Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6's on Sprees
Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This is that ignorant shit you like
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you love
Nigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you need
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus weed, c'mon
I'm only tryin' to give you what you want
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, you like it—don't front!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
They're all actors, lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themselves, don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures
It's mostly backwards, unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa!
This ain't B.R., no, it's S.C., CEO
The next Lyor, no, the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel, go...

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Uhh, take off the cuffs, unlock the gate
It's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate
The '07 Ice Cube, B. Sig so rude
Tell a trick, get these nuts, eat dick like food
Now see if I care if this verse get aired
Even if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah
I'm so raunchy, bitch get off me
Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I missed the part when it stopped bein' 'bout Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit?
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Are you saying what I'm spittin'
Is worse than these celebrattantes showin' they kitten, you kiddin'!
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin', c'mon

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This is that ignorant shit you like
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you love
Nigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you need
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus weed, c'mon
I'm only tryin' to give you what you want

I ain't playing, life's short so I aim

It's twice as hard to get a job that's paying 'em
So I ain't paying attention to what you're saying
Raindrops keep falling on my brain
'Cause I'm in the drop on flames
I'm so hot even if the weather change
I don't have no top, I'm insane
'Member dark-skinned Jermaine
Suede in the rain, I'm sorta kinda the same
'Cept I'm no lame and you gonna know my name
Before I go the world gon' feel my pain
They saying I'm a bad guy, why's that?
'Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga I react

So out comes the mask and gloves 'cause we ain't feeling the love
We ain't doin crime for the sake of doing crimes
We movin dimes 'cause we ain't doing fine
One out of three of us is locked up doing time
You know what this type of shit can do to a nigga mind
My mind on my money, money on my mind
If you owe me ten dollars you ain't giving me nine
Y'all ain't give me forty acres and a mule
So I got my Glock 40 now I'm cool
And if Al Sharpton is speaking for me
Somebody give him the word and tell him I don't approve
Tell him I remove the curses
If you tell me our schools gon' be perfect
When Jena Six don't exist
Tell him that's when I'll stop saying bitch, BEEEITCH!

""Your success took a shot at you. What are you going to do now? How are you gonna kill it? You're gonna become unsuccessful? Frank, you can be successful and have enemies, uh?
Be unsuccessful too, and even have friends.""

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
I got these niggas, Breezy, don't worry about it
Let that bitch breathe!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
'Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big
I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with, with
Shit, let that bitch breathe!
I'm way too important to be talking about extorting
Asking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin
Broad daylight I'll off your on-switch
You're not too bright, goodnight, long kiss
Bye bye, my reply... ""BLAH, BLAH""
Blast burner, then pass burner to Ty-Ty
Finish my breakfast, why?
I got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry
Now where was I?
Let that bitch breathe!
I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more
Truth be told I had more fun when I was piss-poor
I'm pissed off, and this what success is all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out
All of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out
I mean, I like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu?
Hold up, let me move my bowels
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys
(Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!)
I got watches I ain't seen in months
Apartment at the Trump I only slept in once
Niggas said Hova was over, such dummies
Even if I fell I'll land on a bunch of money
Y'all ain't got nothing for me

[Break: Jay-Z]
Nas, let that bitch breathe!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Success, McLaren, women staring
My villain appearance
Sacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello
Camaro driven, I climax from paper
Then ask: ""Why is life worth living?""
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den
Take everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in
Up your catalog, dog, mine's worth too much
Like Mike Jacks ATV pub, Mottola can't touch
Let this bitch breathe! (Ha heh)

I know I should've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm... (fallin')

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uhh, said where I would stop before I even started
When I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like:
""Sorry, God, I lied, but give me one more try"" (try)
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is
Can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night, see how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?
But there's a price for overdoing it
Doing it this big'll put you on the map, stick-up kids is out to tax
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
Damn...

I know it's gon' come right back

When you should've fell back
Now you (fallin'), right into they lap
Fallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen
Damn, you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino
You seen what that last run did to De Niro in Heat
Can't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards
Now your tumbling is humbling, you're falling, you're mumbling
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming (fallin')
Now let's pray that arm candy
That you left your ex for stay down and come in handy
'Cause come January it gets cold, when the letters start to slow
And your commissary's low and lawyers screams appeal
Only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil
Damn, gravity's ill...

[Chorus: Bilal (Jay-Z)]
I know I should've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable (but ya) fallin'

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
And you can't get up
All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on 'em
And the women that you left for this heifer
Got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach
You're sick about what your life is becoming (fallin')
But your use-to's, has-beens, ragging bad about all the new dudes
Talking tough on the YouTube 'bout what you used to do
But that's old school to the new crew
They doing numbers like Sudoku
They're the new you, and it's damn near inevitable
They'll experience déja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive
Run and you'll never escape, so just fall from grace
Damn...

I know I should've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it

So what if you flip a couple words? I could triple that in birds
Open your mind, you see the circus in the sky
I'm Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey with the pies
No matter how you slice it, I'm your motherfuckin' guy
And just like a b-boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige
Whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar
Whip it around, it still comes back hard
So easily do I W-H-I-P
My repetition with wristses'll bring the kilo bidness
I got Creole C.O. bitches for my niggas
Who slipped, became prisoners, treats taped to the visitors
You already know what the bid-ness is
Unnecessary conversary, boy, we live this shit
Niggas wanna bring the '80s back
That's okay with me, that's where they made me at
Except I don't write on the wall
I write my name in the history books, hustlin' in the hall
Nah, I don't spin on my head
I spin my work in the pot, so I can spend my bread

Cherry M3's with the top back (top back)
Red and green G's all on my hat
North Beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game?
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra
I ran contraband that they sponsored
Before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert

Home of the her-on
Era of the hustlers, uh
The world is my custies
New Rich Porter
The way I flip quarters
Front on all these other rap artists, but me
Momma was a mink wearer, papa ran numbers
So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream, I'm living the life still
Way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining
40 below Timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friend's gone
I seen bad days, still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on
I hear his voice in my mind like, nigga live on
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
I'm give it to my sons
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh
Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame
A list of hits next to all my names

And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose on the house
And auction off all my cars

Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardinia
In Ibiza, I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
Billie Jean, the goddamn boy ain't mine
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Rose gold, Rosé flow, I'm okay though
What don't kill me makes stronger than before so
Here we go and I'm not Domino
When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw
I might break but I don't fold, 'til I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah, that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture, ture
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle

Nigga's beats is bangin', nigga, your hooks did it
Your lyrics didn't—your gangsta look did it
So I would write it if y'all could get it
Bein' intricate'll get you wood, critic
On the internet, they like ""You should spit it""
I'm like ""You should buy it, nigga that's good business""
Forget this rap shit, I need a new hustle
A little bit of everything, the new improved Russell
I say that reluctantly 'cause I do struggle
As you see I can't leave so I do love you
But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper
In fact you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper
Back when crack was
What these pills are, I was a real star
Complete with real cars, no video ones
You can come and set up a camera, let the video run
And my real life, complete with real ice
VVS boulders all invisibly set
Head and shoulders, my invisible neck
You see Hova wasn't digital yet
Befo' Steve Jobs made the iPod
Was getting head jobs, we call that interneck
Back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette
With a automatic weapon I was rappin' with a TEC
Fresh like Mannie be, chain like anti-freeze
Shoebox full of cash, dealer man hand me keys
Pantries full of Arm & Hammer, don't take Nancy Drew to see
What it do, I'm a damn G
Just sent a million dollars through a hands free
That's big money talk, can you answer me?
Before the answer was a 3
I was down in Georgetown with a Hoya chick, lawyer chick
Sure he's rich now 'cause he saw the shit, all this shit
That's why they call him Hov, 'cause he came before all this shit
Bought a 6, quarter seven, skipped on them quarter eights
Bought a 9 for non-stop Glock work all the time
Woo! Guess who's back?
Since this is a New Era, got a fresh new hat
Ten year veteran, I've been set
I've been through with this bullshit game but I never can
I used to think rappin' at 38 was ill
But last year alone I grossed 38 mill'
I know I ain't quite 38 but still
The flow so Special got a .38 feel
The real is back, hehehehe",74.7K

You are tuned in
To the greatest
Young H-O-V
Let's go get 'em again, Just
(Oh my God, HOV)

[Verse 1]
Pops sped off, left mom with a bundle of
Joy, ya boy smacked dab in the jungle
Took tunnel vision, but he would soon become a mogul
But first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo
Don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood
First niggas hating on me, it's all good
I'm buying things like my shit don't stink, Gucci links and Gucci gooses
Watching too many movies, bulletproof this
Had some nerve, like pulling tooth'ses
When you're 16, coming through roofless
Yea your boy ""ruthless"", like Ice Cube was
Turn the whole city on, I'm the new plug
So if this is your first time hearing this
You're about to experience someone so cold
A journey seldom seen, the American dream
From the bottom to the top of the globe they call me Hov

[Chorus]
They gunning for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov)

[Verse 2]
Now I'm knee deep in the concrete
Like a street's made a quicksand, it's beyond deep
I got a ""chemical romance"", two left feet
So now I dance with the devil, please G-O-D
Save me from the ""black parade"", release me
My life like Grand Theft Auto, PSP
I'm in that Volvo, puffing on that la-la
Ducking from the po-po, every time I drive by
Say hi to the bad guy, all my momma's friends was like
""Mmm, mmm, mmm"" would you just look at him
So sorry dear momma for your embarrassment
But give me a couple years and pray I'll never sin again
Got all these rival dealers trying to do me in
And all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them I am (I am)
I'm feeling like the world's against me Lord
Call me crazy, but strangely I love the odds

[Chorus]
They gunning for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov)

[Verse 3]
Now these baby ballers, toy rappers
Callin out my name to bring the boy backwards
Shooting air-balls at the basket
What you call money, I pay more in taxes
I got crowned king down in Africa
Out in Nigeria, do you have any idea
Sold out shows out in Seoul, Korea
Jo'burg, Dublin, Tanzania
Lunch with Mandela, dinner with Cavalli
Still got time to give water out to everybody
Everybody, fall back
Y'all rapping, I'm reenacting
CNN, you see it's accurate
ESPN, see me in action
Monday night's, when the half ends
When you 10 years in, holla back then

[Chorus]
They gunning for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov)

I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P
Without the boy H.O.V

So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, I'm ready
When kingdom come I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Now everywhere I go they like HOV you back
Up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and yeah glory to God
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I - take off the blazer loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth Superman is alive

I hear ""hurry up Hov'"" when I'm out in the public
'Cause niggas like: ""but you love it; you be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas""
Had to dust off the Hammer dance, can't touch this
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
'Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking
I thought dudes remark was rude okay
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Rosé
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel 'em from the bottom
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
Peter Park', Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts

Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?

So after this flow you might owe me a favor

[Verse 3]
Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
Guess what New York, New York - we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South
Bout it, bout it, Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homie Bun B
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
I repeat, sing along with me
I run the streets, the streets don't run we
Ladies saying ""Where you been Superman?""
When niggas spending ten million in media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear
When you need me just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah!

Give the drummer some
I already gave the summer some
It's the winter's turn, Hovi Hov is the coldest
I'm just getting better with time, I'm like Opus One
Young, no two alike like a snowflake
Okay, show me what you got babe
Words is slurring, engine purring
Mami front, but I'm so determined
Shots of Patron, now she in the zone
I ain't talking bout the 2-3
Mami in the zone like the homie two-three
Jordan or James, makes no difference
We all ballin' the same
Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recordin'
Nigga, you might want to fall back from recordin'
What you write is not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave they may applaud him
But misery, I will assure them
Aww baby, just ignore them
Truth or dare, mami, listen and learn
I got a drop, I just took off the top, it's your turn

Take your clothes off, you take off mine

It's not a diss song, it's just a real song
Uh, you feel me? Uh

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so, make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one

Lose, one, let go to get one
Get, one, lose some to win some (you lost one)

Sorry, I'm a champion
You lost one

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I don't think it's meant to be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth
To be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele & Jay-Z]
Lose, one, let go to get one
Get, one, lose some to win some (oh yeah, she lost one)
Story of a champion
Sorry I'm a champion
You lost one

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
My nephew died in the car I bought
So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it

Lose, one, let go to get one
Get, one, lose some to win some (Colleek, I lost one)

You know why they call the projects a project
Because it's a project!
An experiment, we're in it, only as objects
And the object for us to explore our prospects
And sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes!
As kids we would daydream, sitting on our steps
Pointing at cars like yeah that's our sex
Hustlers profits made our eyes stretch
So on some Dr. Spock shit, we started our trek
Some of us made it, most of us digressed
In the name of those who ain't made it, my progress
We show success, please live through me
See, I'm the eyes for Emory, keep him alive

Up in the fed, and still holdin' his head
So when he hits the streets he gon' eat through this bread

On the desk I'm the Presidential favorite

I'm talking when spaceships are around and ya great-great grands

For repairing my relationship with my pops before he passed
All I ask is you raise your glass in this celebration
Toast to the most beautiful girl in the world
My inspiration thanks for the information

Out in BK where
It ain't everyday that you make it out
Be on top of yachts waving
I remember you saving for the light bill, paid the rent with the light bill
Now our crib dark as a basement
Had to lock up the phone when you wasn't home
We was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic
Our cable was basic no HBO, WHT, just Ralph McDaniels on the station
I aggravated you for Atari and ColecoVision pinstripe Lee's
When the first day of school came in
I was okay with not having everything
Long as Saturdays you had the Commodores playing
The expression on your face was priceless
Still with me till this day baby girl I won't erase it
I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made
You deserve a standing ovation

Momma I made it... momma I made it

Now your lil misfit make sure every day is Christmas, write out your wish list

Sign it to your nice room leave a extra tip, ma
Be extra nice to 'em

I know pop looking down
I know Colleek somewhere up in the clouds like
Go get 'em Grandma make me proud
Didn't have a man in the house so you made one
So I act like your husband and I'm only your son

You know, you know, you know (you hot)

I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa

Red light, TLC
Through the left eye, my POV
On the iChat
How's that for computer love? She rolled her eyes back
I'm like, ""Ooh you're so nasty""
You turned my Maybach back seat into the Hotel De'Paris
I ain't gotta go down to the go-go
You got a private show that's like Magic City
I got stacks of fifties, I got piles of hundreds
Let's role play, act like you want it
You know, you know you hot like fire
You throw that body, I'll throw them dollars
But not them 1's and not no 5's
Have you ever seen a Grover Cleveland?
That's a thousand dollar bill, baby

Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes

You know, you know, you know
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
I see money when you bounce, bounce
Girl I like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
You know, you know, you hot like fire
As I blow, some dough, you might could retire
Take it slow like Neo, when shots was fired
In the Matrix have patience, got lots of bottles
Rock-a-bye baby Jay-Z got notes like Mariah
Got no 1's got no 5's, my D notes are higher
I'm a D boy, they decoys, they money is lighter
Than Nicole Richie, roll with me, they on a diet baby

[Chorus: Usher & Pharrell]
Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (you hot)

Kingdom Come,Hollywood (Ft. Beyoncé) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-hollywood-lyrics,"[Intro: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
It ain't for everybody! (Uhh)
Welcome to Hollywood, baby (Take a picture)
Uh-huh, you coming with? (Let's not even talk about it)

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
I see your jealousy as you watching (I see you watching me, baby)
You watching (it's all good)
It's kinda sexy to me how you watching (I love it)
You watching (Uh-huh, come on)
I see your face (I see your face)
You wanna touch it (You wanna touch it)
Come to my place (Come to the crib)
And let's discuss it (Let's chop it up)
Tonight you'll be, a superstar
Tonight you gonna be a superstar, baby
Come let me sign you up (Let's get into it)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
Ooh it's the lights

Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high-rise
I hide behind my shades cause the fame is blinding my eyes
My God, I know how Ozzie Oz
Once had felt when he was as high as I have got
I have got to make this stop
People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
It'll change those who said they had love for you into strangers
When your fame starts, it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when the train departs
Stranger, things have happened
Rapping, stacking, platinum plaquin'
Born in Brooklyn, got a place in Manhattan
Going back to Brooklyn to escape the madness
When your friends is, Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous than you then it's
Time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted, it's gon' flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
It's about where you standing when the music stop spinning

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
You got to get it (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Do you want it? (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
But you don't need it (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
What do you do? Oh oh oh oh
Now that you got what you want
What do you do? Oh oh oh, hey
Oh you want more?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Hey mister, pay six-a, a list-a, you're in the mist of
The ride of your life but you gotta keep them hits up
Can't put your guard down, gotta keep your mitts up
Take a sip, sir, it's so intoxicating, ain't it?
Try not to get jaded, Hollywood's been good to ya
Startin' feel like buzz to ya, don't lie
Gon' fly, you addicted to the lights
Without the fame how you gon' survive
It's like living on heroin, you so high

[Bridge: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
And everybody warning you about it (I tried to told you)
And once you taste, you can't live without it (It's addictive)
Not cause you choose to not live without it
You sure you want this, baby?
It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (It's a part of you)
And everybody warning you about it
I see you changed, I see you blinded
And once you taste you can't live

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (Satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Wanna be seen, male groupies
Now you've become what you once despised
James Dean, John Belushi
Blow your whole life tryna live in the lights
Heroins following Marilyn
Hoppin' over the edge just like Janis Joplin
River Phoenix, Jimi Hendrix
Jimmy Morrison, all of them ended by
Hollywood, thank God for Hollywood
Hollywood, sure you want this baby?

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Hollywood
It's the most addicted drug in the world
Want the fame? You want the lights?

Kingdom Come,Trouble Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-trouble-lyrics,"[Intro]
(I done gotten in trouble again)
What the fuck
I tried, man, I'm back
Peace to [?]
(I done gotten in trouble again)
Yeah

[Chorus]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change

[Verse 1]
Now the singer Rob calls the police on me
Y'all niggas ran out and copped the CD
See what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers
I might speak, but I don't fuck with nobody
See what Doug, Jimmy & L.A. don't know
These young'uns crossed the line with Hov', I'm letting it blow
Had the papers writing stories like: ""Didn't they know?
This what happen when they made that rapper CEO""
I know, its just a matter of time before the steady hate
Starts to overflow, then the levee breaks
And my conscience go, ""You escaped the RICO
Why throw everything away over ego?""
You paper chasing, they paper hating
Billionaire Hov', you on the pace to make it
Fuck that, exclamation, comma
Quotation's ""I love drama,"" period

[Chorus]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change

[Verse 2]
Smelling like Patron, singing dirty rap songs
Tip-toeing in the crib like six in the morn'
Every day it's the same, I said in Blueprint
That I'd never change, it's just a part of the game
Respect me I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec
But expect me to bug, it's in my blood
But if my chick leave me she gon' leave me for something
She gon' leave me cause Halle, she ain't gon' leave me for nothing
Picture me getting up with something sleazy
Something, something, so easy
You could take out of Speed like nothing
Soon as you finish cutting, you like, ""leave me please""
Not me, I need Angelina Jolie-zy comfort
So I ain't gon' make a move unless I got a Plan B
That'll happen the day I have a baby by Free
Not to say that anything is wrong with Free
Just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take the cookie, not leave my ring
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take... (*laughs*) y'all know what I mean

[Chorus]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change

[Verse 3]
Unh, you lil' niggas ain't deep you dumb
You niggas ain't gangsta, you gum, I chew lil' niggas
Hock-too, spew lil' niggas
I can only view lil' niggas like lil' niggas
But in lieu of lil' niggas tryna play that boy
I *phew, phew* lil' niggas with the latest toy
Unlike you, lil' nigga, I'm a grown-ass man
Big shoes to fill, nigga, grown-ass pants
Probably hustled with your pops, go ask your parents
It's apparent you're staring at a legend who
Put a few lil' niggas in their place before
Tryna eat without saying their grace before
Blasphemous bastard, get your faith restored
You're viewing your version of the Lord
God MC, lil' nigga, applaud, or
Forever burn in the fire that I spit at y'all
I rebuke you, lil' nigga, the meek shall perish
I'll roof you, lil' nigga, I'm a project terrorist
Cute, you lil' niggas think you in my class
Substitute, lil' niggas soon feel my wrath
I mute you, lil' nigga, you a lil' nigga
I child abuse you, lil' nigga, I'm a ill nigga
Now shoot, you lil' niggas, go somewhere and play
'Cause the day I lose to you lil' niggas, no day

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga

Dig a hole, bury yourself, nigga!
Go head! Keep goin'!
I got some nice dresses for you guys
The incomparable H.O

[Chorus: Sterling Simms (Jay-Z)]
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes)
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
Nothin’ left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered)
And now what’s that you talking bout we gon see now (We gon' see now)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)

Dig a hole (Muthafucka bury yourself)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I’m still here, mon frere!
I know the cross I bear
They like, “That’s why they call you Hov”
I’m like, “Yeah”
I’m like air, lil' shots go through me
Won’t tear one tissue, no tears, no tissue, not an issue
Don’t cry for me
I peep these niggas from deep
Got a front row seat even if you don’t speak
Silent partner, I hear you loud and clear
Left a fingerprint, you ain’t gotta be there
I’m just waiting til’ you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in
Then I’m gon' body them
It's nothing but a hobby to him
Simple as a serve in volley to him
Niggas like, “Hov', why don’t you get at ol’ boy?”
Why kill a puppet and leave Geppetto alive?
Why not wait to catch them all together?
That’s why you dig one big hole, one time

[Chorus: Sterling Simms (Jay-Z)]
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes)
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
Nothin’ left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered)

Dig a hole (Dig a hole)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How is niggas dissin' me
I made it possible
For niggas to make history
How is this possible?
Please explain this shit to me
How is it logical?
Have we forgotten our history?
Let’s open our bibles
It's like the disciples, dissing Jesus and becoming his rivals
Shunning the one thing that they owe they life to
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Knowing good and god damn well this what I do
Think I’m in the office, I’m off my grind?
That’s how kids become orphans
You lost ya mind?
I keep my enemies close
I give ‘em enough rope
They put themselves in the air
I just kick away the chair

Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes)

Hov gon' get you, I ain’t forget your lil' disrespect
No ho, daddy gon' spank you for that shit you said
It's hard to do when you’ve got nothing to prove
Everybody know you better, you in a lose lose
Cause even when you win, ultimately you lose
Real niggas like, “Why Hov talking to Dude?”
You sellin' low too, only time you went plat
My chain was on your neck, that’s an actual fact
So I’m prayin’ that it spills outside of the booth
That’s when ya’ll niggas outside of your truth
Outside of your league, that’s not what you do
Niggas throwin' Roc signs outside of your Coupe
Don’t look at Hov like he done something wrong to ‘em
Cause he’s on to 'em
He just took what belonged to him
You niggas is playing checkers with chess-playing Hov
This game is over, I don’t know if ya’ll know
You in the hole

Kingdom Come,Minority Report (Ft. Ne-Yo) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-minority-report-lyrics,"[Intro: excerpts from news reports]
""The damage here along the Gulf coast is catastrophic
There's a frantic effort underway tonight to find survivors
There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight.""

""People are being forced to live like animals.""

""Please... send stuff here. We are desperate.""

""No one says the federal government is doing a good job.""

""...and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people ...""

""No water... yeah, and I fought for my country for years.""

""We need help. We really need help.""

""In Baghdad, they-they drop, they airdrop - water, food to people
Why can't they do that for their own people?""

""...the same idiots can't get a bottle of water into a
Major American city in three days are trying to win a war""

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
People was poor before the hurricane came
Before the downpour poured, it was like when Mary J. sang
Everyday it rains, so everyday the pain
Went ignored and I'm sure ignorance was to blame
But life is a chain, cause and effected
Niggas off the chain, because they affected
It's a dirty game, it's whatever is effective
From weed to sellin' 'caine, gotta put that in effect, shit
Wouldn't you loot? If you didn't have the loot
Baby needed food and you was stuck on the roof
And helicopters swoop down just to get a scoop
Through his telescopic lens, but he didn't scoop you
And the next five days, no help ensued
They called you a refugee because you seek refuge
And the Commander-in-Chief, just flew by
Didn't stop, I know he had a couple seats
Just rude Jet blue, he's not, jet flew by the spot
What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped
Huh, that woulda been somethin' to watch
Helicopters doin' fly-bys to take a couple shots
Couple portraits, then ignored 'em
He’d be just another Bush surrounded by a couple orchids
Poor kids, just 'cause they was poor kids
Left them on they porches, same old story in New Orleans
Silly rappers, cause we got a couple Porsches
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses
We forget the unfortunate
Sure, I ponied up a mil' but I didn't give my time
So in reality I didn't give a dime
Or a damn, I just put my monies in the hands
Of the same people that left my people stranded
Nothin' but a bandit, left them folks abandoned
Damn, that money we gave was just a band-aid
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis, this is my Minority Report
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis, this is my Minority Report

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
So many times I'm, coverin' my eyes
Peekin' through my fingers, tryin' to hide my
Frustration, at the way, that we treat
(Seems like we don't even care)
Turn on the TV, seein' the pain
Sayin' such a shame, then tryin' to go on with my life
Of that, I too am guilty
(Seems like we don't even care)
So we send a little money, tell 'em it's alright
To be able to sleep at night
You will pay that price, but some of these folks
Has lost they whole life
(Seems like we don't even care)
And then it wasn't on the nightly news no mo'
Suddenly it didn't matter to you no mo'
It went on and almost nothin' changed
What the hell were they there for?

Kingdom Come,Beach Chair (Ft. Chris Martin) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-beach-chair-lyrics,"[Verse 1; Jay-Z]
Geah, yeah
Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me (are you happy, Hov'?)
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life
Colleek, are you praying for me?
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father
So I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays
In hopes that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space in this world of fly girls
Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls
Benzes round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
Some said: ""Hov', how you get so fly?""
I said: ""From not being afraid to fall out the sky""
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul will find an even higher plane to dwell
So have no fear, just know that
Life is but a beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream
Can't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the winner's cup
With winters rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes with this life just eyes
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you, chica
Your corazón is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, Maricón, I am on
Permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair
This song is like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print
A map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes, and so you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you to think
I ink these verses full of prose
So you won't get conned out of two cent
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

Roc-A-Fella forever, Hov' for life
Debut's a classic, first album, four mics
Should've got a five, but niggas lack foresight
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't do it for the hype
I do it for the hustlers for the ghetto for the plight
For the struggle for those who bubble white
For fly 4X4s, roofless cars, flawless ice
For the pain for y'all to know what it's like
For every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights
For every promise made that never saw the light
I'll get my own forty acres, give me four nights
Four O's, a Glock 40 for the jackers and I'm Spike
Or the four-four will suffice
A fourteen-year-old to look out for the vice
You can sit back and just wait for the flight
Your boy'll take off like I've been strippin' all my life
That's the type of metaphors I write
To let niggas know I was real before the mic
Four front rows, had the fur at the fight
No PETA on my Peter, left some room for the divas
In the suite, we'll meet up if ya wild for the night
On a rampage, champagne pours, on the floor
For all those who ain't make it here and lost they life
Wouldn't forget y'all for any price
Not for no hoes, not for no ice
Not for no fame nor for bright lights
So I'ma end this here, a fly ass kite

Come, get some, ya little bum
I take the cake from under the baker's thumb
I bake the cake, get two of them from one
Then I move the weight like I'm Oprah's son
Uh, I show you how to do this son
You need another helping hand to swing on
I stand alone but still you got a thing on
You're Kobe, you're Shaq, Cagney and Lacey
They still can't bake like me
And if I may make this one thing here
Crystal clear, I push crystal, yeah
Push fishscale, quicker than Qadry Ismail
Re-up, three much, break digital scale
Y'all should wish me well like the wishing well
'Cause if this fail...
Then it's back to pitchin' like David Wells
To make this smell, Jay get knocked
Nigga, Jay get bail
Love pick me up in a grey S.L, the great excel
Rap or raw, I'm walkin' a fine line
Now who been gettin' dough since '89?",

Holton street, Dean street
Prezident, Nostrand Ave, Marcy
Orange Ave, RBGs T-Town, who wanna ride
Brooklyn, come on, come on

[Verse 1: stic.man]
Sittin' in the living room on the floor
Hunger pain got me on some migraine shit
But I'm a maintain
Nigga got two or three dollars to my name
And my homies in the same boat going through the same thing
Ready for the caper, steady plottin' for the paper
We been livin' in the dark since April
On the candle, gotta get a handle
My homie got a twenty-five automatic added to the gamble
Nigga get the phonebook look up in the Yellow Page
Lemme tell you how we finna to get paid
We gonna order pizza and when we see the driver
We gonna stick the twenty-five up in his face
Let's ride, steppin' outside like warriors
Head to the notorious Southside
One weapon to the four of us
Hidin' in the corridor until we see the Dominos car headlights
White boy in the wrong place at the right time
Soon as the car door open up he mine
We roll up quick and put the pistol to his nose
By the look on his face he probably shitted in his clothes
You know what this is, it's a stick up
Gimme the dough from your pickups
You ran into the wrong niggas
We runnin' down the block hot with these pizza boxes
So we split up and met back at the apartment

[Hook]
Hell yeah, yo ain't you hungry my nigga
Hell yeah, you wanna get paid my nigga
Hell yeah, ain't you tired of starvin' my nigga
Hell yeah, well let's ride then
Hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 2: M-1]
I know a way we can get paid
You can get down but you can't be afraid
Let's go to the DMV and get a ID
The name says you but the face is me
Now it's your turn take my paper work
Like 1, 2, 3 let's make it work
Then, fill out the credit card application
And it's gonna be bout three weeks of waitin'
For American Express, Discover Card
Platinum Visa, Master Card
Cause, when we was boostin' shit we was targets
Now we just walk right up and say charge it
To the game we rockin' brand names
Well known at department store chains
Even got the boys in the crew a few things
Po Po never know who to true blame
Store after store you know we kept rollin'
Wait two weeks report the card stolen
Repeat this cycle like a laundry mat
Like a glitch in the system it's hard to catch
Comin' out the mall with the shoppin' bags
We can take it right back then get the cash
Yeah, get a friend and then do it again
Damn right that's how we paid the rent

[Bridge x2]
Got to get this paper
I'm down for the caper, we steady on the grind
It's a daily struggle, we all gotta hustle
This is the way we survive

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
As long as there's, drugs to be sold
I ain't waitin' for the system to plug up these holes
I ain't slippin' through the cracks
So I'm at Portland, Oregon tryin' to slip you these raps
The first black in the suburbs
You'd think I had ecstasy, percocet, and plus syrup
The way the cops converged, they fucked up my swerve
The first young buck that I served
I thought back to the block
I never seen a cop when I was out there
They never came out there
And out there, I was slingin' crack to live
I'm only slingin' raps to your kids
I'm only trying to show you how black niggas live
But you don't want your little ones actin' like this
Lil' Amy told Becky, Becky told Jenny
And now they all know the skinny
Lil' Joey got his doo rag on
Driving down the street blastin' 2Pac's song (Thug Life baby)
But Billy like Snoop, got his blue rag on
Now before you know it, you back in 'Nam
Now the police, got me in the middle of the street
Trying to beat me blue, black and orange
I'm like hold up, who you smacking on
I'm only trying to eat what you snacking on

[Refrain]
Hell yeah, y'all don't like that do you
Hell yeah, you fucked up the hood nigga right back to you
Hell yeah, you know we tired of starvin' my nigga
Hell yeah, let's ride, hell yeah, let's ride

[Bridge x2]
If you claimin' gangsta
Then bang on the system
And show that you ready to ride

Can I get a small commercial break?
I think it's time for a small commercial break
Yeah, uh huh
Get up and stretch, I'm ready

[Verse]
Lookin' at them S Dots, it's about that time
To do Michael Jordan numbers
The sneaker game is mine
I ain't made 'em for the ball court, I made 'em to shine
So you can score big when you courtin' a dime
When niggas see me, shit, they see the grind
You gotta be blind you only see the shine
I dropped them S Dots and in record time
The number one seller since they first design
50-50, you know how I handle mine
A nickel for you, gimme my dime
Tell Paul Fireman I got him on fire, man
He ain't been this hot since A.I. was signed
Now a nigga talkin' to Kenyon Martin
Shawn Marion, shit I might be startin'
S Dot NBA niggas
Went from bein' in VA to signin' NBA niggas
I hurdled every hurdle, obtained
Every dame that was out of a nigga reach with my figure of speech
Open the door for my niggas with me
Openin' more for niggas I don't know so all y'all niggas can eat
If it wasn't for S Dot...

Jeah
Yeah, yeah
How real is this, how real is this
Inspect this here, check

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I'm from where the hammer's rung new's cameras never come
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can
And run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt some more something and you nothing check
I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too
Much
So they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul
Just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's
Unforgetable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it
I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs Czars evolve, and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas is praying to God so long that they Atheist
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it
Tomorrow
'Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with
Him yesterday
I'm a block away from Hell, not enough shots away from
Straight shells
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held
Weight scale
Your laughing, you know the place well
Where the Liqour Store's and the base well
And Government, fuck Government, niggas polotic themselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep
Solidifies
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, God strike me And I got a question
Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never
Know
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, I let 'em
Know
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street
From where the pimps, prostitutes, and the drug lords meet
We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether your four-feet or minute size, it always starts out
With
Three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought they douce was live, and now hit 'em with
Trips
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas will show you love, that's how they fool thugs
Before you know it your lying in a pool of blood

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing
Nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing

S. Carter The Re-Mix,Allure (Just Blaze Remix) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-allure-just-blaze-remix-lyrics,"[Verse One]
The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My womenfriends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
My brother hustled so - naturally -
Up next was me...but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends! yet still I play
The starring role in ""Hovito's Way""

[Hook]
""In the valley of my world
You'll be my only girl""
Once again it's the life, Oh no!
""In the valley of my world
You'll be my only girl""
Once again it's the life, Oh no!

[Verse Two]
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa...it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée
Mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say ""hooray"" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the Name of Love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I'm like Pookie in New Jack, cleaned up with the roof back
On the other side of the tracks I produce crack
Still a fiend no less, for the green i just
Go through a thing I guess, brings out my best
Brings out my worse, just the gift and the curse
No one said it would be easy, nigga livin is work
It's hard to not style in the Arnage, or fuck the Arnage
When the Benz doors lift up from the floor
And every night fake willies wanna match ya ball
But I'm far out of reach like Abdul-Jabbar
I'm so into this life, you know who I are
Every corner, every hood, nigga ghetto superstar
It's the life

History, it's happenin' every day, y'all (right now)
Everyday (live, right now)
Right now (good mornin', Vietnam!)

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Listen! Brooklyn wins again
It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, them niggas again
Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and S. Dot on the guest lock
Kanye, you're the dopeman of hip-hop, now let's rock
Now roll out, niggas, my hometown niggas
I get it good in yo hood, so slow down, niggas
Watch the speed though, mind your pedal and ease off
Or screech off into a collision course with these walls
(BAM!) They don't move, don't pray, don't lose
Don't sleep, life passin', light flashin', life happens
That fast, part of done, black hands up in prayer
Black guns up in fear, dyin' wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year, it's another day
It's the same fight, different round, sound the bell
Mix it up in victory, you live it up, the beat'll get risen up
You're knocked down, then get back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get with us
And get clear where we did it, from the heart, from the people
From the top, from the jeep, from the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
So in my absence you feel the presence, exactly
I make contact, for short, I MC
Me and mine we don't just get by
We get free and that's ready [(Mos, nigga!)]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Just to get by
Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lye, carried a fo' five
Claimed I was ready to die, promised never to cry
Held it all inside, reality was too much to take, so I
Kept my mind fried, slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes, then I woke up behind
Thinkin' either I load up these 9's, or blow up with rhymes
‘Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein' your moms
Doin' five dollars worth of work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me workin' McDonald's
I'd rather pull a MAC on you
Sorry, Ms. Jackson, but I'm packin', bye!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yeah! It's somethin' about that Nina Simone piano flow
It's like a Michelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get ya choked up, this is the tree and the rope
This is Chi, nigga, I'm Mr. All-of-That
Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on the almanac
Dice what they hittin' fo', lax what you sittin' on
Tracks who you spittin' on, rap 'til we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me, ""Toughen up, put some bass in your voice!""
They used to tell me, ""Lighten up, put some Mase in your voice!""
Lord willin' I ain't killed nobody
But I have a feelin' this album that I'm gonna make a killin'
Or not a shilling, this is love-it-or-hate-it music
But—at least we made it music
And we didn't make it industry, this is gon' be interesting
This'll be the end of me, or I'm finna be an entity
Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli
We are not makin' songs no more, we're makin' history

[Hook: background singers + (Talib Kweli)]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
But I been thinkin' I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)

We keep it gangsta, say 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'
Desensitized by the violence on the TV during the war
Killin' each other is easy, its pourin' liquor for fallen niggas
Believe me, it's ghetto libation, seen it all before
Just to get by, my people, we get fly
My people, we get high, fillin' cigars with the lah
Nigga, come on! Even Jesus was stoned
Before receivin' the throne
I send a rest in peace to Nina Simone

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Back in the days we was used to doin' the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We was hustlin' fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin' on corners
Waitin' for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin' the week was good, so I could get money back
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin' me smokin' Newports and weed
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my niggas and street mothafuckas
And reach out to wifey, and then I place a call on my mother
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
*Ayo, Mom, pick up the phone, I gotta to talk to you, Ma*
If you was five percent instead of actin' stupid and guessin'
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building in session

[Hook: background singers + (Talib Kweli)]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
But I been thinkin' I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)

[Outro: Talib Kweli]
Some people try, some people try
Just to get by, for my piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie
And we keepin' it fly – yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
When people decice to keep a disguise
Can't see your eyes, see the evil inside
The best people you find
Stronger people in mind

You bowlegged, you frontin', you walkin' awkwardly

[Intro]
The other night when I was researching what was going to be discussed today I came across a passage wrote down, I think it really exemplifies what the young brother next to me was just talking about and I learned that all things must come to an end
It is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence, all things must conclude
Take the analogy of a tree that grows in Brooklyn among the steel and the concrete with all its glorious branches and leaves, one day it too will pass on its legacy through the seeds it dropped to the ground and as the wind carries these seeds throughout wherever they might move a new life will begin for each one of them as they stand as a monument to the one that came before
That came before
That came before
That came before

The Black Album,December 4th Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-december-4th-lyrics,"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
They say ""They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone.""
So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface
'Cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
""Gimme a second, I swear,"" I would say about my rap career
'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I lived with
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody's fault, I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me

[Outro: JAY-Z]
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade...",258.7K

The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up
These fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me
You know what? Soon they forget where they plucked
Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
I'm like, ""TAA!""
I'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin' up my brother
Biggin' up my borough, I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
I'm in, new sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas
What more can I tell you? Let me spell it for you:
W-I, double-L, I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more, New York's ambassador
Prime Minister, back to finish my business up

[Chorus: Hum-V]
What more can I say?
What more can I do?
I gave this up to you
I know this much is true, true, true
My love

[Break: Jay-Z]
What more can I say to you? You heard it all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You already know what I'm about: flyin' birds down South
Movin' wet off the step, purple rain in a drought
Stuntin' on hoes, brushin' off my shirt
But ain't nothin' on my clothes 'cept my chain, my name
Young H-O, pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol, I make payroll
Benz paid for, friends they roll
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos
Cris' caseloads, I don't give a shit
Nigga, one life to live, I can't let a day go
By without me bein' fly, fresh to death
Head to toe 'til the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys, I'm 30-plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button-ups
S. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete
What more can I say? Guru, play the beat!

[Break: Jay-Z (Hum-V)]
My nigga, hahahaha, woo!
We gon' let this ride into the hook
- I'ma snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
- Get my grown man on
LET'S GO!
(What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy?)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag
For like half a billy and your ass ain't lily-White
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly, it's both!
I don't mean to boast, but damn, if I don't brag
Them crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass
The Martha Stewart that's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact, I'm just previewin' it
This ain't the show, I'm just EQin' it
One-two and I won't stop abusin' it
To groupie girls: stop false accusin' it
Back to the music - the Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem, Houston!
What up B, they can't shut up me
Shut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me
So picture me lettin' these clowns nitpick at me
Paint me like a pickany
I will literally kiss TT in the forehead
Tell her, ""Please forgive me,"" then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off, in fact
I got a joint that'll knock your points off
Young Hova the God, nigga, blast for me
I'm at the Trump International, ask for me
I ain't never scared, I'm everywhere, you ain't never there
And nigga, why would I ever care?
Pound for pound, I'm the best to ever come around here
Excludin' nobody, look what I embody:
The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street
A CEO's mind, that marketin' plan was me
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated like, say, a Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
I'm supposed to be number one on everybody list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this man!

The Black Album,Encore Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-encore-lyrics,"[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro]
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're far too kind

[Chorus]
Now, can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Chorus]
Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?

[Verse 2]
(*Sighs*) Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

[Interlude]
Owww, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage
Say ""Hova!"" – c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? [crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""]
C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!

[Break]
I like the way this one feel
It's so motherfuckin' soulful, man!
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay

[Verse 3]
So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this

Tell the whole world the truth is back
You ain't gotta argue about who can rap
'Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps
(New York, New York!) Yeah, where my troopers at?
Where my hustlers, where my boosters at?
I don't care what you do for stacks
I know the world glued your back to the wall
You gotta brawl, do that
I been through that, been shot at, shoot back
Gotta keep a peace like a Buddhist
I ain't a New Jack; nobody gon' Wesley Snipe me
It's less than likely, move back
Let I breathe, Jedi Knight
The more space I get the better I write
Oh, never I write, but if, ever I write
I need the space to say whatever I like, now just

Best believe, I sweat out weaves
Give Afro Puffs like R.A.G.E
Aww you get if could move it
Back it on up like a U-Haul truck
Then run and tell them ducks you heard Hovi new shit
He and the boy Phar-real make beautiful music
He is to the East coast what Snoop is
To the West Coast, what 'Face is to Houston
Young Hov' in the house is so necessary
No bra with that blouse, that's so necessary
No panties and jeans, that's so necessary
Now why you fronting on me, is that necessary?
Do I, to you, look like a lame
Who don't understand a broad with a mean shoe game
Who's up on dot dot dot and Vera Wang
Ma are you insane? Let's just
(What you want me to do?)

Change clothes, and go

Young Hov' in the house is so necessary
No bra with that blouse, that's so necessary
No panties and jeans, that's so necessary
Why you frontin' on me?
Let's go to my hotel, cause this don't go well
With those S. Dots, gotta stay fresh ma
Ma, I don't shop where the rest buy
Ho no ma, please respect my
Jiggy this is probably Purple Label

[Intro]
You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin' greatest (Jigga)
Turn the music up in the headphones (Jigga)
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off, nigga
I got you, yeah, uhh

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 1]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 2]
Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 3]
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

Yo, what's up, pimp, this threats
That's right, that's the, the that's, this threats, pimp
And I'm serious about mine, I'm so sincere
And I, nigga I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up
Put ya inside the mattress like drug money, nigga

[Break: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I done told you niggas 9 or 10 times, stop fuckin' with me
I done told you niggas, 9 albums, stop fuckin' with me
I done told you niggas, the 9 on me, stop fuckin' with me
You niggas must got 9 lives
9th Wonder

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Put that knife in ya, take a little bit of life from ya
Am I frightenin' ya? Shall I continue?
I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song
I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along
Now it's a duet and you wet when you check out
The technique from the two TECs and I don't need two lips
To blow this like a trumpet, you dumb shit
This is a unusual musical I conductin'
You lookin' at the black Warren Buffett
So all critics can duck sick
I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it
Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rilin' me up
For three years, they had me peein' out of a cup
Now they 'bout to free me up, what you think I'm gon' be, what?
Rehabilitated, man, I still feel hatred
I'm young, black and rich so they wanna strip me naked
But you never had me like Christina Aguiler-y
But catch me down the Westside, drivin' like Halle Berry
Or the FDR in the seat of my car
Screamin' out the sunroof ""death to y'all""
You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars
I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head
The whole hood'll want ya, you startin' to look like bread
I send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin' 'bout feds
Nigga, them body-snatchers, nigga you heard what I said

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin'
Put your smarts on the side of your garment
Nigga stop fuckin' with me
R … I … P …

[Interlude: Cedric the Entertainer]
That's right there nigga, nigga I'm wild
Nigga I keep trash bags with me
Never know when you gotta dump a nigga out
This sincere, this some sincere shit right here!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Grown man, I put hands on you
I dig a hole in the desert, they build the Sands on you
Lay out blueprint plans on you
We Rat Pack niggas, let Sam tap dance on you
Then I Sinatra shot ya, goddamn you
I put the boy in the box like David Blaine
Let the audience watch, it ain't a thang
Y'all wish I was frontin', I George Bush the button
For the oil in your car, lift up your hood, nigga run it
Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it
Your boy got the goods, y'all don't want nothin' of it
Like, castor oil, I'll Castor Troy you
Change your face or the bullets change all that for you
Y'all niggas is targets, y'all garages for bullets
Please don't make me park it in your upper level
Valet a couple strays from the .38 Special, nigga
God bless you

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin'
Put your smarts on the side of your garment
Nigga stop fuckin' with me
R … I … P …

[Interlude: Cedric the Entertainer]
Yeah I'm threatenin' ya, YEAH I'm threatenin' ya!
Who you thank you dealin' with?
They call me Threats, nigga
I been makin' threats since I been in kindergarten, nigga!
Huh, ask about me, see if you ain't heard

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
When the gun's tucked, untucked, nigga you dies
Like nunchuks held by the Jet L-I
I'm the one, thus meaning no one must try
No two, no three, no four—know why?
Because one's four-five might blow yo' high
You ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God
It's a match made in heaven when I [blaow] 'splay the 7
Put you on the nigga news, UPN and 11
Where you been? You ain't heard?
Got the word that I'm [pew pew] that I'm so sincere?
I'm especially Joe Pesci with it, friend
I will kill you, commit suicide and kill you again
That's right

I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin'

Whattup? Motherfucker, I keep three motherfuckers what?
Nigga I'll throw a Molotov cocktail
Through your momma's momma's house

[Intro]
Woo! Geah, geah (Young) geah
Uhh, turn the music up, turn the lights down
I'm in my zone

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 1]
Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like, ""Damn, that man's face is just like my face""
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in Heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 2]
Music business hate me ‘cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it, yet they all yell ""holla""
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' – I ain't been rhyming like Common since (Whoo)
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception! Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is)

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 3]
My homie Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall
‘Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See, in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, ‘cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man
You don't hear me though, these words ain't just 'pared to go
In one ear, out the other ear, no!
Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars will scab
What, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga, holla back!

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out

The Black Album,99 Problems Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-99-problems-lyrics,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

You crazy for this one, Rick

The Black Album,Public Service Announcement Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-public-service-announcement-lyrics,"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Jay-Z]
This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records

[Just Blaze]
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov!
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, OH—not D.O.C
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do it Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors (*laughing*)
This ain't a movie, dog (oh shit)

[Interlude: Just Blaze]
Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!
And I don't care WHAT you think about me—but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my ""by any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

The Black Album,Justify My Thug Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-justify-my-thug-lyrics,"[Produced by DJ Quik]

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Uhh, this feel right right here, Quik
It's like it's supposed to happen this one right here
Young! God damn
Let me justify my thug on this one right here

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, Roc
Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock, Roc
11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, the party 'bout to pop
Then, Roc-A-Fella y'all, it's your boy S. Dot
And I ain't never been to jail; I ain't never pay a nigga
To do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell, even if it means sittin' in a cell
I ain't never ran, never will
I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands
To himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
I never asked for nothin' I don't demand of myself
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
I just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt
Before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail
But I never sat back feelin' sorry for myself
If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell
'Til it's heaven

[Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson]
Justify my thug for you
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
To justify my thug
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
For you

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now if you shoot my dog, I'ma kill yo' cat
Just the unwritten laws in rap, know that
For every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin'
Relaxin's what I'm about, but about mine
Don't be actin like you can't see street action
Take me back to Reasonable Doubt time
You see my mind's on the finish line, facin' the wreck
I put my muh'fuckin' faith in the TEC, tell Satan not yet
You understand I am chasin' my breath
I am narrowly escapin' my death, oh yes
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster
Travellin' Mach 5, barrel in my apparel can stop God
God forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you
Until, I won this race, then eventually
My engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me
However it turns out fine, red line!

[Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson]
Justify my thug for you
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
To justify my thug
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
For you

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wronged and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question, right?)
'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin' and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin' tight as lemons on the ave
Tryin' to cop a shop - call theyself cleansin' in the cash
But can't put they name on paper 'cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
Every other corner there's a liquor store, fuck is up?

[Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson]
Justify my thug for you
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
To justify my thug

[Intro]
Kanyeezy you did it again, you a genius nigga!

[Chorus]
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder them first
Emergency, doctors performing procedures
Jesus, I ain't trying to be facetious, but
""Vengeance is mine"" sayeth the Lord, you said it better than all
Leave niggas on death's door, breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy, haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz, flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping ""Brown Sugar"" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles, like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature, ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe, being good Catholics, I'm coming

[Chorus]
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)

[Verse 2]
Yes, this is holy war, I wet y'all all with the holy water
Spray from the Heckler-Koch automatic
All the static, shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical, I throw couple at you, take six!
Spread love, to all of my dead thugs
I pour out a little Louis, 'till I head above
Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the Earth
'til that time, it's on and popping, church
Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel
I let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk, the more you irking us
The more you gon' need memorial services
The Black Album, second verse, is like
Devil's pie, save some dessert for us

[Interlude]
Man, I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy 'til somebody die
Oh man, I gotta get my soul right
'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems it's alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
(Let me get serious for y'all, one second)

[Verse 3]
I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bob's killer
Asking him ""why?"" as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel ya
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass, reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning, thanks again",412.7K

[Intro: Pharrell (Jay-Z)]
(Young! It's the life)
(Once again it's the life, yes)
I don't know why, I.. get so high oh
(It's intoxicating man, y'all don't know why you do what you do)
Get so high oh, get so high, high off the life

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women-friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
Man, my brother hustled so, naturally
Up next was me, but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starring role in ""Hovito's Way""

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (OH NO!)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée, mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say ""hooray"" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (OH NO!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need -
What the game did to my pulse - with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, ""life!"" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-looking corpse
Of course...

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (OH NO!)

[Outro: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]
Once again its the life
Yeah I said its the life
Once I again its the life
(OH NO! I don't know why, I...
Get so high oh
Get so high oh
Get so high, high off the life)",187.6K

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G. in a 1996 MTV interview]
Gotta try to stay above water, y'know?
Just stay busy, stay working
Puff told me, like, the key to this joint
The key to staying on top of things
Is treat everything like it's your first project, nomsayin'?
Like it's your first day, like, back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Y'all wanna know why he don't stop?
Y'all wanna know why he don't flop?
Let me tell you pe-people why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out selling dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin' merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit – that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some Just Me, Myself and I
On some Trugoy shit
Had to voyage to a place of, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo
Like it's '92 again and I got O's in the rental
Back in the Stu' again
No prob' livin' was a whole lot simple
When you think back, you thought that
You would never make it this far
Then you take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent you been given
Ain't no half steppin', ain't no, no slippin'
Ain't no different from a block that's hittin'
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, before you stop
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance
Goodbye! This is my second major breakup
My first was with a pager
With a hooptie, a cookpot and the GAME
This one's with the stu', with the stage, with the fortune
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst like the first song I sang

I make no apologies for what I'm about to do...

[Verse: Jay-Z]
I'm America's worst nightmare
I'm young, black, and holdin' my nuts like ""Chyeah!""
Y'all was in the pub, having a light beer
I was at the club, having a fight there
Y'all can go home, husband and wife there
My mama at work tryna buy me the right gear
Nine years old, uncle lost his life here
I grew up thinking life ain't fair
How can I get a real job? China white right there
Right in front of my sight like, ""Here, yeah
There's your ticket out the ghetto—take flight right here
Sell me you go bye-bye here,"" damn!
There's a different set of rules we abide by here
You need a gun—niggas might drive by here
Y'all having fun, racing all your hotrods there
Downloading all our music on your iPods there
I'm Chuck D, standing in the crosshairs here
Y'all straight, chicks got horse hair here
Y'all ain't gotta be in fear of y'all bosses there
You lose your job, your pop rich, y'all don't care
So I don't care, y'all acting like y'all don't hear
All the screams from the ghetto, all the teens ducking metal here
So they steam like a kettle here
Tryna take they mind to a whole different level here
Yeah, we real close to devil here
Gotta be a better way; somebody call a reverend here
Yeah, y'all must really be in heaven there
Somebody tell God that we got a couple questions here
My lil' cuz never got to see his seventh year
And I'm so used to pain that I ain't even shed a tear

Jay is like the epitome of the American Dream. I mean, he had to come up in a very difficult environment. Um... And he's—Like he said himself, he's been fighting all his life. And, um...

Ain't nobody dumpin' on Hov, you ain’t in sanitation

I'll get you drug out the club, they'll have to carry 'em
Go ahead, bug out, I'll Raid, nigga, scurry
Worry, I'm, not, the Mike Jordan of the mic recording
It's Hovi, baby, you Kobe, maybe; Tracy McGrady
Matter-fact, you a Harold Miner
J.R. Rider, washed up on marijuana
Even worse, you a Pervis Ellis
You worthless, fella; you ain't no athlete, you Shawn Bradley
I ain’t talkin' to nobody in particular
My flow's just vehicular homicide when I’m kickin' up DUST!
Anybody in my path is a car crash waiting to happen
Nigga, WHAT!
I got my foot on the throat on the pulse of this rap game
And I ain’t letting up, YUP!
Who’s the nicest? Life or lifeless on these mic devices
And I don't write this, I just mic this, I will it to happen
One-take Hov, I’m real at this rapping
My new name is Just the Facts
While the rest of y'all just adjust the facts
Put words together, just to match
I say what I feel, y’all adjust to that
I do the opposite of y’all so I just attract
The realer audience usually unjustly Black
Know my flow and the shit they go through just match
Like the sound of my voice and a choice Just track
I just tackle the subject, the flak from the public is nothing
I know real niggas happen to love it
If you don’t like it, then look in the mirror
Most likely you ain’t live it so you don’t get it
You ain’t did it, so you can't vision, the picture I’m painting
Ain't vivid, the language I’m spitting is so foreign to ya
See what starving'll do to ya
Growin' up hard in a little apartment'll do to ya

It's the eventual triple platinum nigga with the solid gold fade
All that nickle and dime shit, don't hold no weight
Fortune 5, top 5 in the Forbes (you'll see)
As you thumb through The Source, I read the Robb Report
Class C, cold me down with the plastic
That's all I ask of you, like Raphael Saadiq
At the Hotel Nikko, Robert Duvall suite
My people's eyes through the peep hole
I'm loving you down freak, as I
Shoot through the city like a rumor
Not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreading
The newspaper heading read ""Jay-Z breathes, 80 degrees
Only thing to cool him off is a Malibu Bay Breeze""
Can't stop for the Feds, say cheese
You know they wanna take a nigga picture
Pray for the day to get ya, but I'ma parlay, stay richer for now
Jigga hasn't done dirt in a while
You know my stomach's getting weak from living life on the streets
For real, I'm trying to oversee it from suites, ordering eats
At the top where the real criminal minds meet
That's where the cream is (right?!)
That's where your dream is (well ain't it?)

Yeah, ayo my youth had a nigga too aggressive, ha
I used to speed excessive, both eyes closed
No thought infested
Hitting pot holes, cop-o's'll snatch your away
What you deem most precious
Had to rethink things, is pinky rings worth
Life on the run and time served in Sing Sing?
I don't know to tell the truth, if I'm pressed for dough
Gotta consult Irv Gotti y'all, heads got to roll
I was raised to live, Lord I pray you forgive
If not, I just handle it like Jason Kidd
What you're facing is official (it's official)
In most cases when I'm blazing won't miss you (won't miss you)
Case and point made bullshit a issue, I see it to the end
My writing so personal, my heart bleeding through the pen
Make no mistake about me
It's only one nigga living, I got half a cake about me
I got love, I can kill a friend over fam not drugs

You make a motherfucker die breathing

Roc-A-Fella...
More flavor than y'all can image having
Graphic like Sega Saturn, traffic like the Bodega
It just so happens, you caught me at the the tail end of my dirt
Brain ain't right from inhaling the work all my life
Fuck it, greasy I, had the whole D.C. high
Pissy off Cristal, 3G high
Seasoned Bacardi, VVS's
Blesses my body, we be fresh at the party
Play yourself go 'head if you don't know the ledge
It's like spitting to God
Get it in your face fucking with niggas over your head
Take your time with me, shifty
Used to make coke stretch like a sample in a 950
Shit with that, while I'm on a Kawasaki bike
At the light, doing a pike, with a bitch on the back
And take flight, my life like it was directed by Hype
In 35 slow-mo, with the Roc-A-Fella logo
Acapulco to Aruba, Bay Breezes and caviar beluga
Very little loot eludes us
In the grayish blueish L-e-x coupe
It's the root of evil in these people, what the fuck?

Let's have a little fun with this one
I got another one
Nigga your shit is trash
When I see you I'ma beat your ass
You better stop playing with me
I don't give a fuck about no magazine
Don't need radio to do my thing
You see me nigga: bling, bling, bling
Take it to the bridge

You better stop fucking around
You're gon' make me chase your coward ass down

I came into this game
Wanting more paper than Puff
Now I realize Puff paper ain't enough
Last week Bleek puffed Puff paper up
And Beans buy a Bentley every week
And I know y'all don't know but G4's ain't cheap
And B she gotta ride G3 (nothing less)
Plus real estate in Miami is highway robbery
Wars cost, I need guns for my robberies
I'm buying tanks, if you're thinking it's just rap
Don't go too far on that verse
Get your whole chest collapsed
It's just the facts
God bless the cats that think I'm a liar
Pick up a paper nigga, read my priors
""Just retire!""
They screaming from the peanut gallery
Not 'til my salary's like the real Mike Lowry
I kill shit 'til I catch Will Smith
Then I'm running Spielberg down (yes)
Everything I say I do, you can feel my words now
Or read about 'em later, nigga
You don't even know me and you mad
How's it feel to be a hater?
Now I know exactly how it feels to be a Laker
I'm in power in a Maybach with the missing towers
With a keyless ignition, eating Chow's
A Nobu nigga, merci beaucoup
I'm in France, I meant Japan
What the fuck wrong with you?
Everybody wanna know my net worth
Niggas wake up on my dick—eat some breakfast first
I'm a legend, I ain't even left this Earth
I'm considered one of the best 'cause I wreck shit the worst
I don't care about no vest, when that TEC hit it hurts
Spinning that Lexus in reverse
Making your next whip a hearse
Best to keep it in the verse
If it leaks into the street, I won't sleep
I'ma creep, 'til I rest one of your peeps
And I promise on my momma, I'm just trying to keep the peace
But I'm an outcast, nigga
So I gotta keep a piece
So when it cock you and shock you, it's a security breach
Don't make me reach point break
I hit you, Point Blank
This ain't a movie dog!

Or in a studio touchin' the track up like pretty women
Spittin' venom with the snake skins and
Apply the pressure to you and ya mens and

Of my own just to hold me is there someone

You niggas is ass, I put your ass in a bad play
This ain't no fair one, get rid of you the fast way
Ski mask way, pull hammers from the coat
This ain't no handgun, this shit'll sink a boat

Red flares in the air don't matter to me
Send the army, coast guard, the whole faculty

Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt (yeah)
Got nice watches, nice cars, nice bitches and rings (c'mon)
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things (that's right)
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake (uh-uh)

And every day, they gotta fight to stay alive

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the barrel, with the chrome, with the lead
'Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flown through your head
I been rich, I been poor, I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone's like the falling of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that 'cause he's observant
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, unseen like Allah's body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the R-shottie, that got cats, likening me
To the mob John Gotti, rap dudes biting me 'cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me, y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly, we mourn all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk 'em through it, you know, talk 'em through it
Know these beats is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness, and y'all knew this when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty in a girdle coming out of B-W-I
(In school) I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi before I die
And it's gon' happen, whether rapping or clapping, have it your way
'Cause if that's my dough you're trapping, I'm clapping your way
It's for the ghetto...

And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive (stay alive)

Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it (uh-huh)
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GSs with BBs on it, supreme schemes
To get richer than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it

High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumference, mad bitches with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestses under they Coogi's
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigger niggas represent
Driving dirty in J-30s gettin' bent (uh-huh)
And to my hit hoes, my murder mamis
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punani, like heiny
And Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw, you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds of choke (uh-huh)
Got lawyers watching lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it

I'm squirtin' often in my loft, of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise, open my eyes, no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half-black, half-oriental, eighty-six, she got me rental

The S. Carter Collection,Russell Simmons Skit Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-russell-simmons-skit-lyrics,"[Spoken: Russell Simmons]
First thing that comes to my mind when you say ""Jay-Z"" is poetry. I mean, his whole—it's his attitude, aside from his words. What's heartfelt about him is, like—it's—you know, it's like—moving words, you know? It's really—it's—it's not just like when you think of rappers, and you think of—you know, um, those are poets. But his—his main... The good thing about Jay is that his integrity is what sells. What crosses over is his honesty. So he's never been untrue to himself—his self, and, uh... I think, see—as much as he seems to be a mainstream artist and has sold mainstream numbers, he's always spoken to the heart of his—his, uh—his environment. Other words: as he's traveled, he's seen new things, but through the eyes of someone who—who, um—obviously didn't have all the access. You know, he came from a place of struggle. And he sees the world as a person who's come from struggle. And so that honesty and that integrity that's always inherent in his music is what gives him his range. People buy him from places... People who are from places that are far removed from where, uh, Jay-Z came from, and the worlds that he's described, and even the kind of viewpoint that he has as a result of his history. Those people love him for his integrity and his honesty. Jay-Z reminds us that the truth sells. Uh, a lot of rappers—uh, uh—become more commercial. I mean, as the world—you know—more commercial aspirations for record companies that really, you know, pushed—put pressure on artists, kind of giving them these—these guidelines, and uh—these high numbers that have to sell to kind of live in this rap world. They kinda—some are inspired by that, and some write songs that sound like they're compromised by that. Jay-Z has contributed, um, uh, another honest blow to the integrity of hip-hop

Everybody wanna rhyme like Hov'
'Cause I rhyme like I be rhyming in the Rov'
Climbing in them hoes
Mind like a diamond, I’ll blind you at the shows
I don’t shine, I glow, I remind you of that dough, don’t I?
Did I? Hustle the game just the thought alone
Give me a boner, coach cater to a coma
Can’t out hustle a hustler, you can’t outplay a player
This rap shit is a layup
In my former biz, motherfuckers would spray ya
In the music biz, motherfuckers just say stuff
Spit on you and spray yeah niggas just play tough
When the cameras on, When the cameras gone
Niggas want to set up meetings
'Cause they know most likely when I see em’ I’m a set up a beating
Windows no tints, cars no rims
That’s because we handle ours like grown men
I ain’t touch a wheel since I drove the Bent
That’s cause it was a coupe, nah I ain’t souped
I was telling the truth and you Tom Cruise
You can’t handle it, handle it nigga is what I do
I tried to be modest on Blueprint 2
But y'all don’t respect modest, y'all respect my dollars
You got to believe I think like a artist
But my bills through the roof can’t do numbers like The Roots
No disrespect I be trying to disconnect
But niggas keep pulling me back in, I’m trapped in
My pops got a liver disorder
My whole living's disordered, and I just got his living room ordered
And you wonder why the chip on my shoulder is more like a brick or a boulder
You’ll understand maybe when you get older
Got a hundred niggas on your dick saying you ought to record like this
Or what have you, niggas is back stabbing you
Bitches mad at you, ‘cause they can’t have you
Press want to know about the daughter of Matthew
Now it’s back to the hood again, all black hood again
Back to old ladies saying what I could’ve been
Back to the gats – you forgot I’m real good with them
They goin put a nigga in jail, oh well

If I can’t, do it, homie it can’t be done

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I’m the one – I’m not the two not the three not the four the five
I take the pain from my life pour it all aside
Take my strain and my stride, take my ego and pride
Used them to kick down the door, brought my people inside
And I hope you, ain’t think I wrote this
To entertain you, 'cause that ain’t what I came to do
I will bang you, I will act like orangutans do
I give you hot wings turn niggas to angels
Understand my angle, I’m safety first
Don’t make me act like the safety don't work

I ride through the ghetto windows down halfway
Halfway out of my mind music on 9, blasting Donny Hathaway
Me and my niggas spending half the day
Plotting, how we gon' get this math today without getting blast away
I wake up to the same problems after today
Life is harsh, nigga got a right to spark
Right from the start, they place me in the ghetto, tender age of nine
My tender mind had to surrender to crime
Wouldn't wish this on nobody life to end up like mine
Ever since I was quite young a nigga been in a bind
Had to scratch for every plaque, even rap ain't even all it's cracked up to be
Niggas don't stack up to me
Had to hustle in a world of trouble
Trapped in, claustrophobic, the only way out was rapping
America don't understand it, the demographics I tapped in
I'm the truest nigga to do this, nigga, and anything else is foolish
Like those who stay high, under God's grey skies
My lyrics is like Bible, made to save lives
In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly
Never let em see you frown, even smile when you down
Shit, I floss on my off-days, fuck what they all say
Niggas can't stop me with rumors, I'm too strong
All day, socks explode and sweatpants pockets is bulging
Holdin' it down on the corner with my block frozen
My spot is rolling, drop the price on the coke and
Drove the competition out and let the dough flow in
The cops is closing in, I can do the time
But what's really on my mind, there ain't no hoes in the pen
I play the low and try and make it hard to find me
Feds still tryna build a case since '93
I told them I'm retired, but they like whatever
You know them pigs don't wanna see you get your life together

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in this life forever
The more things change the more they stay the same
Who am I to change the game?
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
The block's hotter than its ever been

[Verse 2]
Hold the gun at eye level, I ain't afraid of conflict
I let the nine rip, nigga say ""hi"" to the devil
I blind with the bezel, I'm in line with the ghetto
What y'all niggas afraid of, my mind or the metal?
Niggas tryna subtract my life, my mathematics is precise
I carry the 9, so fucking with me just ain't the answer
I just can't lose when I was young I was like Fresh
Poppa raised me to chess moves
And though you're gone, I'm not bitter, you left me prepared
We got divided by the years, but I got it from here
Don't sweat that, sounds bump from Marcy to LeFrak
To that project in DC where my man caught his death at
Over my years I've seen Rooks get tooken by the Knight
Lose they Crown by tryna defend a Queen
Checkmate in 4 moves, the Bobby Fischer of rap with raw moves
In a time where we all move
Let's face it: either you're dough chasing or basing
Lacing, crack's got you feelin' strong like Mason
Careful, any infiltration, I'm leaving niggas
Leaking more than just information

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in this life forever
The more things change the more they stay the same
Who am I to change the game?
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
The block's hotter than its ever been
I'm stuck in this life forever

(AAOOOWWWW!!!) it's so rock and roll
Jay skateboarder...

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I be the king of the Roc, there is none higher
Fuck 'Jay-Z' - y'all should call me sire
I won't stop rocking 'til I retire
I got Lyor rich, y'all got niggas fired
I'm a cash cow, nigga, I'm 'bout to cash out
'Bout to drop The Black Album and back out
I ain't gotta come back out to pull that Maybach out the garage rap's my hobby, spending money's my job
Army in the cup (cup), Giorgio Armani special cut
Scooby Doo's walkin' on you mutts
I'm back on it the famous face with the mask on it
Playin' laser tag with the mag, you can not want it
You can get it in a New York minute
I draw a square and I dare you to walk in it
Listen, you're a square, don't get your corner bended
You're a circle, I will hurt you, you're a zero, I'm a hero
I should fear no man but God
Yet and still I could chill in the City of God's in Brazil
I'm that real was selling crack in the building
Back when selling crack in the building was a big deal, I'm that chill
It's like having ice on the face of a watch when I enter the spot time stands still
Ill, check out the metaphors I build
Made me bigger than U.S Steel, tell em' Phar-real

[Chorus: Pharrell (Jay-Z)]
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now (the game is Hova's now)
Something on your chest, better get it off
They'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Said it's almost over now (the game is Hova's now)

[Bridge: Pharrell (Jay-Z)]
You, can't be me, I'm a rock star
I'm rhymin on the top of a cop's car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
(It's almost over now, the game is Hova's now)
I guess, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
(It's almost over now, the game is Hova's now.. nigga!)

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
It's so motherfuckin' rock and roll Jay skateboarder
I wanna send a, special shout out to Bleek, man
Hahahaha, yes, Baseline Recordings
S Dot collection in stores
Black Album 'bout to change the face of music
(Yes, yes, yes)

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
You, can't be me, I'm a rock star
Y'all rhymin' from the back of a cop car
Y'all pointin' niggas out like, ""there they are""
(It's almost over now, the game is Hova's now)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
As tough as niggas is talkin', it's no wonder I'm still walking
I've been runnin' New York so long I'm exhausted
Now fuck forfeit, nah get the fuck off it
Or get knock the fuck off it
And I'm talking to uh, fuck it you're all sick
And I'm fucking with you ma 'cause I don't give a fuck about your boyfriend
I'm spiteful, if I don't like you
I'm liable, to buy you, then drop you
I son niggas like I adopted you, deliver shots like a doctor do
Not the one from The Watcher 2
It's Young, I'll back your soldiers down
It's almost over now, the game is Hova's now

Uh, the Mike Jordan of rap, Mike Jackson of pop
The Mike Tyson of street, Airs with no socks
The Hugh Hef of the game, yeah it won't stop
'Til I meet the Lara Croft of the hood, it's all good
The Spielberg when I spill words to tracks
I'm a sick dude, you can't feel worse than that
For you slow-minded dudes I reverse it back
I got a sick flow, see ain't no nursin' that
But mami, if ya rock my world
I'll get you the baby bucket, you can be my baby Roc girl
The white Nike Airs, we call em' Wifey Airs
Size 4 or 5, how cute is your size
That new cute bubble, give you horses to drive
I paint that picture, 'cause ain't no nigga
Like the one you get from, Mike holla

[Michael Jackson]
I don't think they're ready for this one

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed

I cannot explain the things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my life)

And there ain't nothing we could find
Someone like you to call mine

H to the izzo
Make ya leave your Jerky Boy like Frank Rizzo

Clap, clap, clap, clap
Before we lose it, Trackmasters bring it back, let's go

[Verse: Michael Jackson]
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is fully complete
Our love is true because of you
You're doin' what you do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for allmy life

Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find

Huh! Watch this y'all
It's Kid Capri and Jay-Z, come on!
It's Jay-Z and Kid Capri, don't stop, huh-huh!
'Cause I'm like that y'all, yeah
I'm really like that

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
As a young'un, dumb and gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'
My motto is, simply ""I will not lose!""
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors
Still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats
This is, not a game this is not why I came
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life, I shall return

[Chorus: Liz Leite (Jay-Z)]
How tight is your flow? ('Cause I'm like that yo)
How right is your dough? ('Cause I'm like that yo)
How white is your blow? ('Cause I'm like that yo)

How white is your blow? (Uh huh, 'cause I'm like that)
Only, write what you know (Watch this, yeah, watch this yo)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm a hop skip and a jump from grippin' the pump
Spittin' a couple of curse words, and hittin' you chump
Shit, I get digits in lumps
I'm a motherfuckin' problem, is this what you want?
Overachiever, I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper
I hate the ones that blow up ya beeper
'Cause I, go in deeper, I only bone divas
Impregnate the world when I come through your speakers (ha ha!)
Fuck hot, my records got the fever
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up
I creep up when the beef heats up
Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, 'bout to snooze off
Hatin', 'cause you can't turn the booze off
You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all
I might bark at X, or spit at The LOX
But, other than that, I don't be fuckin' with cats
Just me, Ty and B-High, thug it like that
E, Dame and Biggs, what's fuckin' with that?
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothin' for that
Other than a couple of slugs in ya back (ha ha)
Rappers y'all, runnin' around like I won't gun ya down
Last nigga that fronted, two shots spun him around
Lord, accept this offerin' here's somethin' for your crown (please)
I meant no malice, I just met his challenge and won

How tight is your flow? ('Cause I'm like that yo)
How right is your dough? (Just like that yo)
How white is your blow? ('Cause I'm like that yo)

Khaliq, Ramel, Pharrell in the house

Neeveen akh kuch chir paake rakh le
Palle vich mukhda lukake rakh le

Yes, live from the United States
Brooklyn New York its ya boy, Young

Neevee akh kuch chir paake rakh le
Palle vich mukhda lukake rakh le

Aiven kari na kise de naal pyaar
Mundeya ton bach ke rahi

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Labh Janjua]
Soon as the beat drop, we got the streets locked
Overseas, at Panjabi MC and the Roc
I came to see the mamis in the spot
On the count of three, drop your body like it's hot
1, Young, 2, You 1,2,3
Young Hov's a snake charmer, move your body like a snake mama
Make me wanna put the snake on ya
I'm on my 8th summer, still hot -- Young's the 8th wonder
All I do is get bread, yeah I take Wonder
I take one of your chicks straight from under your armpit
The black Brad Pitt, I mack 'til six in the AM
All day I'm P-I-M-P, I am simply
Attached to the track like SMPTE
It's simply good, Young Hov, infinitely hood
Ni tu kari na kise de naal pyaar
Mundeya to bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi muteyaar
Mundeya to bach ke rahi

Saanbh ke rakh ni eh joban butari
Hun mud ke na aauni eh bahaar

[Verse 2 : Jay Z]
Ma, I ain't gotta tell you, but it's ya boy Hov
From the U.S., you just lay down slow
Catch ya boy mingle in England, meddling in the Netherlands
Checking in daily under aliases
We rebellious, we back home
Screaming, ""Leave Iraq alone!""
But all my soldiers in the field, I will wish you safe return
But only love kills war, when will they learn?
It's International Hov, been having a flow
Before Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow
Before Ronald Reagan got Manhattan the blow
Before I was cabbing it there back and forth
Raw we had it all day, Papi in the hallway
Cop one on consignment to give you more yay
Yea, but that's another stor-ay
But for now, mami, turn it around and let the boy play (Jay)

Oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige, Pharell & JAY-Z]
I'm taking out this time (uh huh, uh huh)
To give you a piece of my mind
This what we do 'bout this time of year
Who do you think you are? (uh huh, uh huh)
Baby one day you'll be a star

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
(Oh, shit)
Started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin' for creamin' - bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart.. and a real live nigga nature

[Pre-Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

[Chorus 2: Mariah Carey]
I will climb a mountain high aha
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin' dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tongue-kissin', you was truly with it
Little Ecstasy, Hennessy, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin' walls 'til them bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite
Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature, feel me!

[Chorus 3: Mary J. Blige]
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
(Young's in the building)
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you playas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a playa see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it, good me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a playa eating, yeah",

What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
It's the thought of a ride that make my eyes wide, I'm caught up
I'm tryna make all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta
Say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow
I found a new route, you 'bout to see my life change
I make the means justify the ends
I make the cream, materialize keys to a Benz
And so I'm rollin'
For now, holdin' down the fort, who's controllin'?
The ground's gotta blow 'em, yep, y'all shoulda told 'em
Uhh, my first felony's approachin'
Copped my first key, took a freeze, now I'm frozen
I bought a black MAC, I'm outta control
Losin' bankrolls on blackjack, you gotta know
It always crossed my mind
That Feds be tappin' the lines like Gregory Hines
Still on the phone, discussin' my biz like it could never be mines
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life, uh

I'm like the bass with the ass, splashin' cold cash
The Big Willie get you chilly when I pass, brrrrrr
Is it, just a mirage all these girls thankin' God?
Is this, world my world? Am I the star of stars?
Baby, pimped out, I'm gettin' too large and smokin' cigars
All chicks is hollerin' about Jig-ga, the whole city's buzzin'
Wasn't checkin' for me a dozen or so, months ago
Now I'm all they know, I'm a person (yeah)
Lettin' the Cristal's breathe at the Barnacle Bar
Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's
I'm talkin' big cheese, you gotta be down to dig these (uhh)
Uhh, give me a rush like you wouldn't believe
My head's about to bust, acceleratin' what drives me
Hope I don't gotta die to see, see, I can't lie to me
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life

Uhh, from the beginnin', see, we never seen the endin'
Runnin' up in all the women, all the linen, all the jewels, huh
We sported Pele's, gold diamonds and Pirelli's
Sports cars, the good life'll give you a belly
But that's cool, as I zone in the Al Capone, watch me
'Cause the Medusa's head on Versace turned me to stone
Now my poems just ain't poems, they bloody when I recite 'em
Bones get disconnected like the phones
Now, I'm a hardened criminal with game
Like the Garden, all my penpals life controlled by the warden
Still the thrill makes me blind to the fact
I could do real time, I'm a prisoner of my crimes
Know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Now I'm incarcerated for my life

Yes! I'ma take this time out to talk to you about The Black Album real quick

It's like the book ends for the whole career... you know
We gon' take it all the way back
It's a time peat circa '88 to '94, maybe 95'
We'll put a little bit of '95 in there, you know what I'm saying?
All the things that lead to songs like Friend or Foe or D'Evils you know what I'm saying?
You know all those activities you know what I'm saying? Yeah
It's ya boy Hov!
We gon' take y'all back to school, real quick

We gotta adjust the game, put it back where it's suppose to be
We gotta put back the integrity back in music man
You know what I'm saying?
Check it out!

[Verse]
There's rules to this shit, consult the OGs
Before you dudes make one move on the strip
Before you move your lip, take the tool off your hip
I'll show you how to do this shit
I'll tell you what type of car to buy
What type of shoes to get
What type of jewels to cop, you could rule this shit
Manolo Blahnik or Jimmy Choo's for your chick
You gotta treat her right if she gon' mule your shit
Do you know the type of damage love could do
If she feels she's getting taken advantage of? Ouu!
If you want her on the stand
Standing up like a down chick suppose to?
Here I'll coach you, Young ain't fake like most dudes
Young move weight like Cool J's trainer's a no brainer
And don't be wearing no vest with no banger
That just makes you a target
Young used to run the block, now I corner the market
'86 your bullshit, man get smart kid
But you ain't want to do no small bid
Incarcerated with the hard heads, acting like you hard head
That's all dead, get yourself the hog's head
Cheese, we could all get, R.S.V.P
Man we used to play dolls here
Wet niggas with the faucet, come through get your car ran
Ran errands for the bosses
'Til I became one, now I got linen in the closet
I got the blueprint, you just gotta follow it
Rule number one, real niggas never gossip
Rule number two, own The Black Album you gotta cop it

[Outro]
Hehehehe, hehehehe
Yeah man, we just gon' bring it back to the game man
Black Album, S Dot
It's the collection

[Hook]
Memph Bleek always smoking that la la la
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la la la
Neptunes tracks smoke like la la la
It's the Roc, baby; sing our lullaby (C'mon)
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically
Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami

[Verse 1]
I know my English ain't as modest as you like
But come, get some, you little bums
I take the cake from under the baker's thumb
I bake the cake and two it up from one
Then I moved the weight like I'm Oprah, son
Uhh, I show you how to do this son
Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry patterns
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden
He patterns his-self, the rap JFK
You wanna pass for my Jacqueline Onassis, then
Hop ya ass out that S-Class
Lay back in the Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask
Have you in your long-legged life
Ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?
Look but don't touch, motherfucker, think twice
'Cause this gat that I clutch gotta little red light
Need a light?


[Hook 2]
(To smoke that la la la)
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la la la
Memph Bleek always smoking that la la la
It's the Roc, mami; sing our lullaby
C'mon
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically
Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami

[Verse 2]
We got bottles full of Arme, mamis in Manolo
Bags by Chanel or Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a 10 chances you're with him
If you're a 5 you know you riding with them
Sick with the pen, nigga -- no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription you can prescribe to subside his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like Rain Man, twitching
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens
Can dead his sickness, no Ouija board
You can't see me, dog; nigga, ya CB4
This ain't Chris Rock, bitch -- it's the Roc, bitch
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket
Yao Ming?

[Hook 3]
Still smoking that la la la
Memph Bleek still smoking that la la la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle the .45
It's the Roc, baby; sing our lullaby
C'mon
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically
Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami

[Verse 3]
Forget English, talk body language
I be all over mamis like body paint is
Pink diamond necklace, strawberry wrist
Please excuse yourself, you're very sick
Don't confuse me with Marbury out this bitch
Run up on me at the light, you could lose your life
Motherfuckers must be smoking they la la la with crack
Forty-five gun smoke, choke off that
Let's get back to the music, I ain't with all that
Plus the Feds tapping my music -- y'all get all that?
I'm the public industry #1
Public industry #2 is my whole crew (R.O.C.!)
Now I ain't down with who like me or who like you
That's gay, I ain't into liking dudes no way
But get a pen, I can tell you pricks my plans for the future
I never make the news again, my man'll shoot ya

[Hook 4]
As we smoke that la la la
Memph Bleek still smoking that la la la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle the .45
It's the Roc, bitch; sing our lullaby
C'mon
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically
Hold up -- skip all the singing let's get right tonight, mami

Swizzy... Beatz...

[Chorus]
Ayo I cannot (STOP), I will not (STOP)
AS.. WE.. PROCEED..

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Young Hov got the block on smash
Put the gun to the back and hop on some ass
Nigga fresh-dressed and stay poppin' tags
Put the Ewings on the truck 'for I drop the rag
Bitches want to bring up the topic of my past
It's legendary in the hood how I got my cash
I'm legendary in the hood so I got the mag
And I've never been a fronter so I've got to blast
Will I flash... not...
As I'm not playing with you motherfuckers the laughter stops
When your casket drops
You bastards not gon' assassinate the name I got
Ya'll don't hear me though
Young Hov got the block on smash
And everybody and their momma want to stop my cash
Everybody want drama with the top of the brass
'Til I come through hop out the cap
1-8-7 they ass

[Bridge]
(STOP) somebody gon' (DROP)
Y'all don't hear me though...

[Chorus]
I cannot (STOP), I will not (STOP)
AS.. WE.. PROCEED..

[Verse 2]
Young Hov got the game in a frenzy
Twenty million sold all independently
So when you mention me
Make sure you got together your similes
Like he's the game's J.F. Kennedy
Uhh, I started out I ain't have no chimney
My ma was Santa Claus, well at least she pretended to be
'Til one night, well that's if memory serves me correct I caught her under the Christmas tree
Young Hov ain't have no pops
Thank God man I had the block
Ya'll don't hear me though
You young fucks got the game all wrong
This is my life man this ain't no song
You ain't livin' your rhymes out, you live at your mom's house
In that tight-ass room, pullin' that [?] out
And the mirror pointin' at your reflection, killing yourself
You American Pie, stop feeling yourself
Nigga, you just a worker, go deal yourself
Stop being a server, get a meal yourself
Where your heart at, all that yick-yack, ain't nobody scared of y'all gats
We got bigger ones
I mean niggas done shot at me shivering
They were so scared they ain't hit me once
Young Hov 'bout to go to the range
'Bout to work on perfecting my aim
Y'all don’t hear me though

[Chorus]
I cannot……
I cannot……
I will not……

What's up baby girl! (oooh!)
Thought I had to talk to you again, missing you (hey, ey, ey, ey)
Tim is missing you, Missy's missing you
Rashad is missing you, your mom is missing you (n-n-n-n-no no no)
Your pop is missing you, Dame is missing you
Damn we missing you... WOO!!!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)]
All we listen to is all the different yous
4 Page Letters, in addition to
Have you ever loved somebody used to get the party popping
We used to party-hop, we used to be in the Hamptons, party a lot
We was The Breakfast Club, you was a part of the ROC
We used to make up special names for the food we ate
Remember cereal pie, one of your favorite plates (I miss you)
Well Dame told me tell you he's doing well
Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue
But I ain't got to tell you, you looking over us
Our little angel, but you know what

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)]
Brooklyn's missing you, Detroit is missing you
New Orleans missing you, Philly's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Your uncle's missing you, your family's missing you
Your fans is missing you, Valerie's missing you
Damn we missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)]
Now Star is mad I won't grant him an interview
Now he's dissing me, 'cause he dissed you
Can you believe the nerve of this dude?
'Cause of your memory I won't bring it to pistols
(Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you)
But he got issues, enough of that lame
I never seen pain like your parents' pain
But I know God protecting you
You used to read Seat Of The Soul, I know God perfecting you (I miss you)
All the extra hue, the darker texture you are
The more intellectual you are
So professional, our little purple star
Too good for earth you are (I, miss, you)

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)]
Houston's missing you, L.A.'s missing you
D.C.'s missing you, Chicago's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Kidada's missing you, Chak' is missing you
Carline is missing you, Tiny is missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
By the way, B.I.G., we missing you, Pac, we missing you
We feel your presence just not in the physical
All across the world, blocks is miserable
Y'all left a void, it's a lot of little yous
But they not original and they not identical
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews
I swear in hip hop, if it's not ten of you
Then it gotta be more, y'all left your paws
Footprints on the game, hood ain't been the same
Feeling ain't been in music, hooks ain't been the same
But I'm doing what I can, man
Tryin to follow y'all down memory lane, man
B.I.G., you'd be ashamed to see New York gangbang
Pac, you'd feel the same thing, they use your name in vain
But I guess that's the issue
And it proves how much niggas really miss you

[Interlude: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)]
Pun, we missing you, Big L, we missing you
Left Eye, we missing you, Jay, we missing you
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, the list goes on
The world is missing you, the hood is missing you
(Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you)
Nah mean, miss y'all (I miss you)
This goes, to the memory of all our fallen soldiers
Soldiers and soldierettes, all across the world (I miss you)
We gon' hold y'all down, y'all living in our memories forever
We never gon' let y'all go

[Outro: Aaliyah (Jay-Z)]
I, can't, think, no, more (we not remembering y'all death though!)
Since you went away (we celebrating your life, nah mean!)
I don't really feel like talking, don't wanna hear you love me
Baby (yes!) do you understand me (yes, yes, yes!)
I can't do a thing without you (damn we missing you)
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you, I miss you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you, I miss you",
Blueprint 2.1,A Dream (Ft. Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-a-dream-lyrics,"[Intro]
It was all a dream

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Last night I had a dream, thoughts was racin through my head
Felt so real to me, this is what was said

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
""Had a dream,"" I said; ""Bout who?"" he said
""'Bout B.I.G.,"" I said; ""That's big,"" he said
""Dig what he said""; ""Proceed,"" he said
""Indeed,"" I said, so, breathe I did
""Don't repeat what I say,"" I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said
""It came to me like a whisper last evening,"" I said
""What's the deal, playboy?"" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead
""Mo' Money Mo' Problems,'"" better believe it,"" he said
""Careful what you wish for, you might receive it,"" he said
""I see,"" I said, ""jealousy"" I said
""Got the whole industry mad at me,"" I said
Then B.I. said, ""Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!""
""I agree,"" I said, ""my one of a kind self""
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
""What he said,"" I said, ""has been said before""
""Just keep doin your thing,"" he said; ""say no more""

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke, ""duh-ha, duh-ha""
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the (World Trade)
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

Blueprint 2.1,Hovi Baby Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-hovi-baby-lyrics,"[Intro]
Yes, yes YEP!
Welcome to the.. Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some
Uhh

[Chorus]
Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable
Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)

[Verse 1]
Follow the flow, look
They say a midget standin' on the giant's shoulder can see much
Further than the giant.. (the giant..)
So I got the whole rap world on my shoulder they tryin' to see
Further than I am... (than I am..)
And I have been tryin' to be patient with they preoccupation
With David and Goliath.. (Goliath..)
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course
And I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)
But me and Tyran, comin' through your environment
Iron mask, nigga, iron gats, nigga I am back
With ""The Team,"" no I in that
R.O.C., y'all not eyein' that
Y'all don't see, clearly 'cause the rain ain't gone
""The Dynasty,"" no not Ming but Shawn's
Dame, Kareem, nigga it's the gangsta team
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason, we got a gang of green
If there's better at gettin' cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga
(WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!) Jeah, jeah

[Chorus]
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable

[Verse 2]
Jeah, look
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm 'bout to start another life
Look behind you, I'm 'bout to pass you twice
Back to the future, gotta slow up for the present
I'm fast, niggas can't get pass my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session
Ain't no livin' person can test him
Only two restin' in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight Summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get it I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
And that goes for everything from flippin' that raw
Flippin' whores, flippin' vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)

[Chorus]
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)

[Verse 3]
Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order, the number one rap recorder is back
You cats over-felt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the real for real
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Why I'm in the position that I am
Changin' the game, my game could nail Madonna
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the makin', Pistol Pete
Leave competition shakin' without missin' the beat (woo!)
Chasin' the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holdin' it's breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow-tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Live and direct, I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
Rapper slash Exec., Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
You ain't a factor, who are you foolin'?
You all are faggots, you takin' us backwards (takin' it backwards)
I'm tryin' to progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga your whole career's a accident
Who was gassin' 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

[Chorus]
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)",69.7K

(Watcher!)
Jeah.. uhh..
Shit I do for a livin', nigga
Shit I eat for a livin', nigga (Watcher!)
That's how I live for a livin', nigga... (Watchin'!)
Okay, let's do this (The watcher!)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers, claimin' they bangers
Doin' all sorts of twisted shit with their fingers
Disrespectin' the game, no home training or manners
I was doin' this shit when you was shittin' your Pampers
I was movin' them grams
'Fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was
Duckin' the vans, radars, the scanners
Before you knew what ""hard,"" ""white,"" or ""tan"" was
I was hittin' the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, cuz aight with them hammers
I was prickin' my finger 'fore you knew what a fam' was
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mil' later, now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us comin' through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night?
Grand fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was puttin' Peter Pan up in your room
Y'all fuckin' with whom?
Allow me to retort:
You cowards is just now learnin' the shit that we taught
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
'Bout a high-speed Porsche
I.e., you niggas ain't know how to floss
'Til I came through the door, like ""Eric B. for Prez""
Respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us ‘cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking 'em so long, fucking your lil' neck up
Now, you too big for your britches
You got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hef', but you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggas that got life really like what I sing
‘Cause they know it's really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I don't write
Be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game
Word to the hyphen in my name
J-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa
The past, present, nigga, the future, proper
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us
We give Dre his props, but that's where it stops
It's the Roc!

[Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still droppin' flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top, had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets; they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the man
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane
The odds that I played
The best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher

[Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

[Verse 3: Rakim]
I'm rated R, my brain contains graphic things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
It's like watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic—the object? A fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it
But those that haven't got it take away to add a profit
It's catastrophic, I take the gat and cock it
And I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine, and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open—the watcher

[Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know

Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with mebitch
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

That should be hanging with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come, hang with me? (Ooh, oh)
Possibly, can I take you out, tonight?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You already know what it's hittin' for
Ma, I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with? The truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sexcuse me... damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
I got my Gaja 9-7 on right now
Lady
You gotta puff a J to this one
Can't roll a blunt up to this one boy
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? (AOWW!)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be rollin' wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady, what's your name?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be rollin' wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's
Lady
Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name?
This for the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy
So hot to trot, lady, what's your name?
Woo!
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done
...but I'm done readin' for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role
I'm 'bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin'
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

[Outro: Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Lady
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name?
So hot to trot, lady! What's your name?

Blueprint 2.1,All Around the World (Ft. Latoiya Williams) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-all-around-the-world-lyrics,"[Intro: Jay-Z]
Swear to God I just touched down

[Chorus: Jay-Z (LaToiya Williams)]
All around the world.. (same song)
Killer Cali, nigga (same song)
A-T-L (same song)
Real-adelphia.. dude it's all around the world

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
London, England, South of France
And all points between they know about your man
Konichiwa ladies when I'm out in Japan
I'm a Tokyo Giant like Ichiro, I am
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw
Spot me the hotel, the Cap', or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like ""Oui""
Your man'll stand manta ray, handlin' a steak
And handlin' a model, standin' about five-eight
Five-nine, fine wine, fine dine, either that
Or I'm mixin' in Switzerland, tryin' to buy time
Ballin' out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali
Brunchin' at the 4 Seasons, off the heezy
Then it's back home, nigga, back to the zone
Nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me

[Chorus: Jay-Z (LaToiya Williams)]
All around the world.. (same song)
Brooklyn bombers (same song)
Detroit players (same song)
Chi-Town.. all around the world

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Said it's all love, Shore Club, M-I-A
Party at bungalow eight, when I stay
Pool look like a hundred Beyonce's
A couple fiances, I'm the new DeVante
Come and Talk to Me, mami in the Yves Saint
Laurent, I hope, she ain't too young
Only twenty-one and older let another nigga mold her
I'm just tryin' to show her how a baller and a roller
Sleep one place, tell the pilot to keep the engine
Runnin', then I wake up in Martha's Vineyard
St. Bart's this year, I think I'm gon' spend Christmas
Reminiscin' 'bout the time my mom couldn't spend Christmas
Now I'm gon' send her on her own little wish list
Anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl
Forever my lady, blind crippled and crazy
A ticket and your favourite CD - sweet Sade

[Break: LaToiya Williams]
Sade, Sade, don't you know I love you sweet Sade, Sade
All around the world

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Said it ain't where you from yo it's where you at
Real niggas out in Brooklyn, some niggas don't clap
It's real killers out in Cali, some niggas just act
Hollywood like they out the hood, it's all to the good
Real players in the D-Twa, some of them throwed
Slackin' on they mackin', rest haven for hoes
Real pranksters in the Chi, most of them real folks
Disciplined Gangsters, come on Charlie I know
Shit, it ain't about your city or borough
It's 'bout if you really as thorough
And if you are, holla at your boy
I put my hand on my heart, that means I feel you
Real recognize real and you lookin' familiar
I'm a Bed-Stuy nigga but I do it to death
I promise I'm in St. Thomas homie eatin' at Chef's
One-twelve, A-T-L, the sun up yet?
Then we party like the sun don't set

[Outro: LaToiya Williams]
We gon' take you all around the world.. it's the same song (same song)
Everywhere (same song)
It's the same song (same song)
We gon' take you all around the world.. same song (same song)
Same song (same song)
Same song (same song)
All around the world..

Blueprint 2.1,Guns & Roses (Ft. Lenny Kravitz) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-guns-and-roses-lyrics,"[Intro: Lenny Kravitz]
Yeah it's magic
Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz
And it's a Heavy D production you bastards
Come on
Ha, hey yo stop playing man
This is real serious
Ha (It's the rock) yeah yo
Let's go

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Let's go
Post Positano, Hov' hanging with Bono
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you, too, can cool out poolside at the Delano
If you, too, flow like you was out of your mind yo
'Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonald's
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know
And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who knew estates, throw it away
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now here's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action
They say when you play with skills, good luck could happen
Let's go

[Break: Jay-Z (Lenny Kravitz)]
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
Let's rock

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit
You got it Kris-crossed ain't no turning me backwards
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual, he's criminally attached
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors
By dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to the riches through trafficking
Through rapping and whatever's happening
Rocawear, I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
Every time I get out they put me right back in
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow, I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
In case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon

[Break: Jay-Z (Lenny Kravitz)]
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) Let's rock (c'mon)

[Chorus: Lenny Kravitz]
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Tote more Guns than Roses, foes is
Visibly shook of the invisible bully (let's go)
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
In order to experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain
You know the saying, somebody's loss is another's gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
Everything evens up, you just wait
Even a garbage can gets a steak
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith
But when it turns your way before it turns away
Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay
You'll get return in your investment if attention you pay, let's go

[Break: Jay-Z (Lenny Kravitz)]
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) That's right (c'mon)

[Chorus: Lenny Kravitz]
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

Blueprint 2.1,U Don't Know (Remix) (Ft. M.O.P.) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-u-dont-know-remix-lyrics,"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Sample: Bobby Byrd]
(I'm not trying to be no big thing, no no)
(I'm not trying to give you no advice)
(I don't claim to be) (no philosopher)
(But I sure know, this is life, baby, baby)

[Intro: Jay-Z (over sample)]
You gotta let this one breathe, Just
Just let it breathe for a second
Yup! Hovi's home!
The newest addition to The Roc, M.O.P
The Blueprint 2 is on its way
I know y'all hear my footsteps out there, I'm coming
Let's go get 'em Just!

[Interlude: Lil' Fame]
Time to dump (fiyah!) dump (fiyah!)
Dump (fiyah!), dump (fiyah!), dump (fiyah!!!)
(You don't know, what you're doing, doing, doing, doing)
It's the M.O.P.!

[Verse 1: Lil Fame]
And the zip code is 1-2-3, and motherfucker we coming
100 miles and gunning, I'm still running with cats that rob
From the era of XL 80's and hatchback Saabs
(SAME GAME!) Operation for this industry lockdown
We still tote hammers that go blak-ow, run up if you wanna
Believe me dawg, these hammers with they owners
Fuck your G up, have ya with blue Pampers in a coma
And your family now moan, look seventy pounds gone
A little fuck, shriveled up with a hospital gown on
(WE HOLDING IT DOWN HOMES!) Keep pushing we fell, bastards
To get over, we prowl with slippery shell tactics
Chippety frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups
Lil' nigglet,, what the fuck you recording for, Nick Jr?
(THE GAME AIN'T CHANGED) it just got harder
Plus we sponsored by Laze, Dame Dash and Mr. S dot Carter
Brownsville (YEP!), we stomp through this bitch all day
Rock with my cock out, face the crowd and piss off stage

[Verse 2: Billy Danze]
I'm from the G side of thangs, where we ride and bang
With a heat that'll flame, that's how we got the name
(WARRIORS!) Embedded in ya brains
And someone should be telling 'em the veterans have came
And we're better in the game, you better make it rain
(27 a gram) My man, it's better than cocaine
Now everything will change and this Family will rule the world
And you haters can eat a dick up 'til you hiccup and earl!
A decade on the grind, nigga I paid mine
So it's my time to shine and for you to ride the pine
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb-ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids (M.O.P.)
The O.G.'s repped and survived around this motherfucker
(FIRST FAMILY!) We kept it live around this motherfucker
When it's crunch time, we do it our wizzay
Fo' shizzle my nigga, learned to grip pistols in B.K

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Turn my music high, high, high, high-er

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Mo' fire, more Rocawear attire
Mo' money, mo' murder now that M.O.P.'s hired
Mo' further for the Roc Empire, y'all won't serve us, y'all nervous
Know them guns on full service, ready to fire
One body, two body, three body, four
Young sitting on paper, I'm above the law
Young shitting on haters, I ain't fucking with y'all
For my Brownsville neighbors, How About Some Hardcore
And it just get worser every time I sign my signature in cursive
Just add another million to these verses
One million, two million, three million, four
And the money's really worthless, I'm pissing you off on purpose
My nephew's situated and my mom is straight
So I'm ready for whatever drama should come my way
And you niggas rapping to me, so your drama is fake
You dudes is noodles, I got more ziti to bake
You dudes is cake, I keep two biscuits on the waist
Razor blades under the tongue, I will eat your face
Appetite for destruction, I am starving today
Got a money hungry lawyer that'll eat the case
And that's just food for thought, don't let it go to waste
Nigga bite the bullet until you stuffing your face, ha
I done forgot more than you ever learned
What you don't know will make yo' home a permanent urn, nigga

You don't know, what you're doing - doing - doing - doing

Blueprint 2.1,Meet the Parents Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-meet-the-parents-lyrics,"[Intro]
Woo!
Uhh, uhh
It's The Gift and the Curse
Uhh, uhh, yeah
First they love me, then they hate me, then they love me again
They love me again
Let's take a trip down
I gotcha

[Verse]
Let's take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain, grey skies, seems at the end of every
Young black life is this line, ""Damn, him already?
Such a good kid,"" got us pourin' Henn' already
Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above
When it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love
So, give Big a hug, tell Aaliyah I said hi
Till the next time I see her, on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him 'cause, in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn
Poor Isis, that's his mama name
Mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?
Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him
Hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him
Isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him
Damn near impossible, only men can raise men
He was his own man, not even him can save him
He put his faith in a thirty-eight in his waist
But when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate
End up dead before thirty-eight, and umm
That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world
Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away
Isis' life just ended on that rainy day
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed
Down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude
Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew
Angel dust, dipped in WOO!
She slipped into her own fantasy world
Had herself pregnant by a different dude
But reality bites and this is her life
He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife
It was just this night when moon was full
And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight
Had her soundin' like Lisa Lisa, I wonder if I take you home
Will you still love me after this night?
Mike was the hard head from around the way
That she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype
Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
He was a Willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like
It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
But Isis liked this Broadway life
She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red, green, and whites
Hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight
She was so turned on that she had to shower twice
How ironic it would be some fight that
Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life
See, Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene
Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
Sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like
""If that was my son, he would look much different
See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark""
So it's mama's baby, papa's maybe
Mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets (fuck niggas want?)
Had his old reliable thirty-eight gun in his reach
It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak
He runnin' around like life's a peach, 'til one day
He approached this thug that had a mean mug
And it looked so familiar that he called him ""Young Cuz""
Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you)
Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub
He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up)
There was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before
It's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' hisself more mature
And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war
(What's that?) He who hesitates is lost
He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank
The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct
Six shots into his kin, out of the gun
Niggas be a father, you're killin' your son
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons

We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life
Some way, we gotta make it up out this life

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Whether we dribble out this motherfucker
Rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker
Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker
Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker
Some day the cops'll kill a muh'fucker
I don't always wanna be this drug dealing muh'fucker, damn
Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride
Through the sky, I
Used to play the hall and fifth floor, me and my boys
We all poor getting high, I
Seen the worst of the worst, I deserve every blessing
I received I'm from the dirt
I, planted my seed on unfertile land
Myrtle Park, Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand, and
Still I grew, some how I knew that the sun'll shine through, and
Touch my soul, take hold of my hand
Look man, a tree grows in Brooklyn

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Some how some way
I gotta make it up out the hood someday
Some how some way
I gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
Some way, I gotta make it up out this hood someday

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
(To Lil' Nell, Sigel Street, I ain't forget you)
Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck
Nosey neighbors and haters keep they face on stuck
Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up
Moms smoke, kids can't chase the ice cream truck
Girls fighting over rope, the young boys hype things up
Niggas fighting over coke, the young boys light things up
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up
'member Lil' Eddie draw, man how he light mean up
Then they wonder why we light green up
Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't, I lean up
Ain't the L or the reefer that steam up (that steam up)
It's my head and I'm stressed to the point I get a fever
Thinking 'bout the block and all the mothers and kids
That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed 'em
For the rest of their life
Fucking wings, fried vegetable rice (gotta be kidding)
No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night
Our kids eating lunch at night
In their beds all bunched in tight
No less than three or four (you know how it go)
Two by the foot two by the headboard
Man I'm getting scared for them (yeah I know)
That's how I feel for them
And we gotta grip of shorties on the block
All they do is smoke weed and drink forties, cop their quarties
Enough to get the latest ROC, newest Glock, and old Jordies

[Chorus: Beanie Sigel]
Some how some way
We gon' make it up out this hood one day
Some how some way
We gon' make it up out this life, yeah
And some how some way
We gon' make it up out the hood one day
Some way, we gon' make it up out this life

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Right here another lil' story 'bout this clique I claimed
Got another chapter based on how I get that game
Just hanging round my neighborhood, bang my street
Sit and watch the passer-bys play my sweep
South-side, Sunnyside
Is the blocks I run, South Acres, South Park
Nigga all got guns
Over here we got this code Charlie, get that there
We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that now
Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps
Working inside a smoke house starving to death
Serving these niggas flippers, quarter-ounces and jippers
Agents snapping your picture
Neighbors plotting to get ya
Situations is critic
I was out here be getting it
Living it like a savage 'cause nigga I gotta have it
They holding back on a motherfucker, I'm in it for the haul, dog
Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all y'all
Lord be willing and the creek don't rise
I'ma be a nigga and these streets gon' rise
(Some how some way)
(Some how some way)
I'ma be a nigga and these streets gon' rise
(Some how some way)

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some way, we gotta make it up out this life

Uhh, just point out the bounce
Uh-huh, show me the bounce, yeah
Just point out the bounce, yeah
Timbo the king, yeah
Young Hov' the king, yeah
Just point out the bounce
Yes, just point out the bounce nigga
Yo, listen

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Rumor has it The Blueprint classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevera
Now it's a whole museum of, Hov MCers
Everybody dupin' the flow, you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like you tryin to make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like - oh shit, he's so handsome
Still in demand in the longest run standin
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin to Canton, I'm now eligible

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga
Uhh, I got y'all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
For those that think Hov' fingers bling bling'n
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is, and single that out
To be the meaning of what he is about
And bein I'm about my business, not minglin' much
Runnin my mouth, that shit kept lingerin'
But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinklin'
The album width to keep the registers ringin'
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Jeah, you jinglin' baby
See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real OG should
Oh, he's good, no he would never sell out, he's so hood

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Magazines call me a rock star, girls call me cock star
Billboard, pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-Town go-gettin' pimps, we mobsters
Gingerbread Man even said, ""You're a monster!""
Yeah, that's how I feel
To be down, you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated R
O.C., OG, Bobby Johnson son
Ask me, ""Ray Ray, is that yo' car?""
I seen MTV, I know who you are
You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas?
I did take over the game, brought back the soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum to go, yeah that's the flow
All I, know, I gots to blow
And I don't play pause I'm from Chicago

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C

Blueprint 2.1,What They Gonna Do Part II Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-what-they-gonna-do-part-ii-lyrics,"[Intro]
Oh yeah, uh-oh
Y'all know who it is (He's back)
Young!

[Chorus]
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with me (Woo), just grind to the bassline (Come on)
Niggas, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside

[Verse 1]
Now what the fuck they gon' do with me?
Got money, got broads, got a crew with me
Real as banana clips, I got a zoo with me
Get down or lay down, nigga, to shoot with me
Now how the fuck they gon' deal with me?
I ain't going nowhere, they gotta deal with me
Got the whole BK ready to kill with me
You scared, motherfucker? Keep it real with me, keep it real with me
Now what the fuck they gon' say to me?
Got to clap, ya mean? All day with me, clap, ya mean?
Don't play with me, clap, ya mean?
Stay with me, don't lose me, y'all
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different
I bought it back for a living
Thirty-three O's on a bitch back like Pippen
Three she can keep for herself and distribute
Thirty-six O's and a ki', you do the addition
Before Mitchell and Ness did it
I was moving birds like a Oriole fitted
I'm Cal Ripken Jr. let's get it

[Chorus]
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab it from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside

[Verse 2]
Mami, what they gon' say to you?
Got your hair did and your favorite shoes
Tell 'em don't play with you, get 'em away from you
You need a baller like I, call 'em like I
See 'em like, ""Nah""
Move over, y'all amateurs
No, you not balling, that's Pro-Am shit
Oh, stop calling, that's ho-man shit
Stop falling asleep, that's old man shit
I stands up in it like a champ up in it
Be up in it so long, get my calls transferred in it
No more minute man in it
Get my SoundScan, BDS, and Marketing plans in it

[Chorus]
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Line)
Homie, don't be scared to grab it from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside (What they gon' do?)

[Verse 3]
You got starch in your flow, I flow too many ways
Got a arch in my flow, all sorts of flow
Rembrandt, Rilke, I am art with the flow
Even if I'm guilty, you gotta pardon the flow
Niggas takin' it lightly, had to darken the flow
Way I put it together, tear 'em apart with the flow
I'm too smart with the flow, you just started to flow
Stop it youngin, you 106th & Park with the flow
I am pro, as you see, I'm off the charts with the flow
Actually, I'm number one on the charts with the flow
In some places they say this, I am God with the flow
Like my office, but they're biased, too involved with the flow
Although I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow
Trouble Man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow
I come up hard but I evolve with the flow
Crossover, slam dunk, Rucker Park with the flow (Young)

[Chorus]
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab it from behind

Young Hov got the block on smash
Put the gun to the back and hop on some ass
Nigga fresh-dressed and stay poppin' tags
Put the Ewings on the truck 'for I drop the rag
Bitches want to bring up the topic of my past
It's legendary in the hood how I got my cash
I'm legendary in the hood so I got the mag
And I've never been a fronter so I've got to blast
Will I flash... not...
As I'm not playing with you motherfuckers the laughter stops
When your casket drops
You bastards not gon' assassinate the name I got
Ya'll don't hear me though
Young Hov got the block on smash
And everybody and their momma want to stop my cash
Everybody want drama with the top of the brass

Young Hov got the game in a frenzy
Twenty million sold all independently
So when you mention me
Make sure you got together your similes
Like he's the game's J.F. Kennedy
Uhh, I started out I ain't have no chimney
My ma was Santa Claus, well at least she pretended to be
'Til one night, well that's if memory serves me correct I caught her under the Christmas tree
Young Hov ain't have no pops
Thank God man I had the block
Ya'll don't hear me though
You young fucks got the game all wrong
This is my life man this ain't no song
You ain't livin' your rhymes out, you live at your mom's house
In that tight-ass room, pullin' that [?] out
And the mirror pointin' at your reflection, killing yourself
You American Pie, stop feeling yourself
Nigga, you just a worker, go deal yourself
Stop being a server, get a meal yourself
Where your heart at, all that yick-yack, ain't nobody scared of y'all gats
We got bigger ones
I mean niggas done shot at me shivering
They were so scared they ain't hit me once
Young Hov 'bout to go to the range
'Bout to work on perfecting my aim
Y'all don’t hear me though

Yes, live from the United States
Brooklyn New York its ya boy, Young

Neevee akh kuch chir paake rakh le

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Labh Janjua]
Soon as the beat drop, we got the streets locked
Overseas, at Panjabi MC and the Roc
I came to see the mamis in the spot
On the count of three, drop your body like it's hot
1, Young, 2, You 1,2,3
Young Hov's a snake charmer, move your body like a snake mama
Make me wanna put the snake on ya
I'm on my 8th summer, still hot -- Young's the 8th wonder
All I do is get bread, yeah I take Wonder
I take one of your chicks straight from under your armpit
The black Brad Pitt, I mack 'til six in the AM
All day I'm P-I-M-P, I am simply
Attached to the track like SMPTE
It's simply good, Young Hov, infinitely hood
Ni tu kari na kise de naal pyaar
Mundeya to bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi muteyaar
Mundeya to bach ke rahi

Ma, I ain't gotta tell you, but it's ya boy Hov
From the U.S., you just lay down slow
Catch ya boy mingle in England, meddling in the Netherlands
Checking in daily under aliases
We rebellious, we back home
Screaming, ""Leave Iraq alone!""
But all my soldiers in the field, I will wish you safe return
But only love kills war, when will they learn?
It's International Hov, been having a flow
Before Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow
Before Ronald Reagan got Manhattan the blow
Before I was cabbing it there back and forth
Raw we had it all day, Papi in the hallway
Cop one on consignment to give you more yay
Yea, but that's another stor-ay
But for now, mami, turn it around and let the boy play (Jay)

Whooo! Whooo!

[Hook]
Memph Bleek always smoking that la la la
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la la la
Neptunes tracks smoke like la la la
It's the Roc, baby; sing our lullaby (C'mon)
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically
Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami

[Verse 1]
I know my English ain't as modest as you like
But come, get some, you little bums
I take the cake from under the baker's thumb
I bake the cake and two it up from one
Then I moved the weight like I'm Oprah, son
Uhh, I show you how to do this son
Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry patterns
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden
He patterns his-self, the rap JFK
You wanna pass for my Jacqueline Onassis, then
Hop ya ass out that S-Class
Lay back in the Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask
Have you in your long-legged life
Ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?
Look but don't touch, motherfucker, think twice
'Cause this gat that I clutch gotta little red light
Need a light?


[Hook 2]
(To smoke that la la la)
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la la la
Memph Bleek always smoking that la la la
It's the Roc, mami; sing our lullaby
C'mon
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically
Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami

[Verse 2]
We got bottles full of Arme, mamis in Manolo
Bags by Chanel or Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a 10 chances you're with him
If you're a 5 you know you riding with them
Sick with the pen, nigga -- no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription you can prescribe to subside his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like Rain Man, twitching
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens
Can dead his sickness, no Ouija board
You can't see me, dog; nigga, ya CB4
This ain't Chris Rock, bitch -- it's the Roc, bitch
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket
Yao Ming?

[Hook 3]
Still smoking that la la la
Memph Bleek still smoking that la la la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle the .45
It's the Roc, baby; sing our lullaby
C'mon
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically
Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami

[Verse 3]
Forget English, talk body language
I be all over mamis like body paint is
Pink diamond necklace, strawberry wrist
Please excuse yourself, you're very sick
Don't confuse me with Marbury out this bitch
Run up on me at the light, you could lose your life
Motherfuckers must be smoking they la la la with crack
Forty-five gun smoke, choke off that
Let's get back to the music, I ain't with all that
Plus the Feds tapping my music -- y'all get all that?
I'm the public industry #1
Public industry #2 is my whole crew (R.O.C.!)
Now I ain't down with who like me or who like you
That's gay, I ain't into liking dudes no way
But get a pen, I can tell you pricks my plans for the future
I never make the news again, my man'll shoot ya

[Hook 4]
As we smoke that la la la
Memph Bleek still smoking that la la la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle the .45
It's the Roc, bitch; sing our lullaby
C'mon
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically

Let's do this thing (let's do it right this time)

I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
Naw, naw, don't be afraid
Y'all and your articles hock spit at Jay
Y'all from afar threw darts my way
What you thought, I would not have nothin' to say? Nope!
Y'all fell into the booby trap
I set the trap just to see dude react, and now
And now you's can't leave
You opened the door, God, I'm at you annually
And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is
But you can't give cred to anything dude says
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head
Shorty, it's time to wake up the dead
You sound a little naive in them articles that I read

Can't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of T.D. Jakes
Prophesizin' on your CD's and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith?
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line (It's real)
Donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed in myself?
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help
They call me this misogynist
But they don't call me the dude to take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics, depositin' checks
They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip (Yap, yap, yap)
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
'Cause the nigga wear a kufi, it don't mean that he bright
'Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write (The fuck is you sayin'?)
Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic?
Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty owe you for ice?
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, for even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that, though (Ha ha)
Savin' me the hassle of speakin' to half of these assholes
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov'
I get the spoils 'cause the victor is me (Me, nigga!)
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
You street dreamin', all y'all niggas livin' through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgettin' you emcee
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob – listen, God, you a flea
And the little homie Jungle is a garden to me
What's the problem, B? You not as hard as me
Nigga, hard as we, nigga, R-O-C, nigga
That's why they follow me
They feel my pain and my agony, nigga
I won't rest 'til you on one knee
You want war, then it's war it's gon' be, nigga
Until you on one knee
You want war, then it's war it's gon' be, nigga

""Dig what he said""; ""Proceed,"" he said
""Indeed,"" I said, so, breathe I did
""Don't repeat what I say,"" I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said
""It came to me like a whisper last evening,"" I said
""What's the deal, playboy?"" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead
""Mo' Money Mo' Problems,'"" better believe it,"" he said
""Careful what you wish for, you might receive it,"" he said

Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke, ""duh-ha, duh-ha""
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the (World Trade)
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky

Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good

[Chorus]
Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable
Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)

[Verse 1]
Follow the flow, look
They say a midget standin' on the giant's shoulder can see much
Further than the giant.. (the giant..)
So I got the whole rap world on my shoulder they tryin' to see
Further than I am... (than I am..)
And I have been tryin' to be patient with they preoccupation
With David and Goliath.. (Goliath..)
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course
And I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)
But me and Tyran, comin' through your environment
Iron mask, nigga, iron gats, nigga I am back
With ""The Team,"" no I in that
R.O.C., y'all not eyein' that
Y'all don't see, clearly 'cause the rain ain't gone
""The Dynasty,"" no not Ming but Shawn's

Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason, we got a gang of green
If there's better at gettin' cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable

[Verse 2]
Jeah, look
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm 'bout to start another life
Look behind you, I'm 'bout to pass you twice
Back to the future, gotta slow up for the present
I'm fast, niggas can't get pass my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session
Ain't no livin' person can test him
Only two restin' in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight Summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get it I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
And that goes for everything from flippin' that raw
Flippin' whores, flippin' vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)

[Chorus]
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)

[Verse 3]
Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order, the number one rap recorder is back
You cats over-felt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the real for real
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Why I'm in the position that I am
Changin' the game, my game could nail Madonna
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the makin', Pistol Pete
Leave competition shakin' without missin' the beat (woo!)
Chasin' the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holdin' it's breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow-tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Live and direct, I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
Rapper slash Exec., Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
You ain't a factor, who are you foolin'?
You all are faggots, you takin' us backwards (takin' it backwards)
I'm tryin' to progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga your whole career's a accident
Who was gassin' 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

[Chorus]
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)",69.7K
The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse,"The Watcher 2 (Ft. Dr. Dre, Rakim & Truth Hurts) Lyrics",https://genius.com/Jay-z-the-watcher-2-lyrics,"[Intro: Jay-Z]
(Watcher!)
Jeah.. uhh..
Shit I do for a livin', nigga
Shit I eat for a livin', nigga (Watcher!)
That's how I live for a livin', nigga... (Watchin'!)
Okay, let's do this (The watcher!)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers, claimin' they bangers
Doin' all sorts of twisted shit with their fingers
Disrespectin' the game, no home training or manners
I was doin' this shit when you was shittin' your Pampers
I was movin' them grams
'Fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was
Duckin' the vans, radars, the scanners
Before you knew what ""hard,"" ""white,"" or ""tan"" was
I was hittin' the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, cuz aight with them hammers
I was prickin' my finger 'fore you knew what a fam' was
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mil' later, now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us comin' through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night?
Grand fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was puttin' Peter Pan up in your room
Y'all fuckin' with whom?
Allow me to retort:
You cowards is just now learnin' the shit that we taught
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
'Bout a high-speed Porsche
I.e., you niggas ain't know how to floss
'Til I came through the door, like ""Eric B. for Prez""
Respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us ‘cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking 'em so long, fucking your lil' neck up
Now, you too big for your britches
You got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hef', but you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggas that got life really like what I sing
‘Cause they know it's really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I don't write
Be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game
Word to the hyphen in my name
J-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa
The past, present, nigga, the future, proper
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us
We give Dre his props, but that's where it stops
It's the Roc!

[Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still droppin' flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top, had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets; they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the man
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane
The odds that I played
The best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher

[Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

[Verse 3: Rakim]
I'm rated R, my brain contains graphic things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
It's like watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic—the object? A fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it
But those that haven't got it take away to add a profit
It's catastrophic, I take the gat and cock it
And I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine, and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open—the watcher

[Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri]
I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low",110.9K

Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with mebitch
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

You can't roll a blunt to this one
You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J
You gotta puff a J on this one [inhales]
You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one
You gotta drink Crist-ALL
Buy some red wine, a little Gaja 9-7
You're so contagious, I can't take it
This is for the grown and sexy, uhh
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name?
Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be hanging with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come, hang with me? (Ooh, oh)
Possibly, can I take you out, tonight?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You already know what it's hittin' for
Ma, I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with? The truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sexcuse me... damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
I got my Gaja 9-7 on right now
Lady
You gotta puff a J to this one
Can't roll a blunt up to this one boy
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? (AOWW!)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be rollin' wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady, what's your name?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be rollin' wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's
Lady
Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name?
This for the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy
So hot to trot, lady, what's your name?
Woo!
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done
...but I'm done readin' for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role
I'm 'bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin'
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

[Outro: Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Lady
You're so contagious, I can't take it

You scared motherfucker, keep it real with me, keep it real with me
Now what the fuck they gon say to me

Don't play with me, CLAP, yi mean
Stay with me, don't lose me y'all
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different

I flow too many ways, got a arch in my flow
All sorts of flow, Rembrandt, Rilke
I am art with the flow
Even if I'm guilty, you gotta pardon the flow
Niggas taking me lightly, had to darken the flow
Way I put it together, tear 'em apart with the flow
I'm too smart with the flow, you just started the flow
Stop it youngin, you 106th & Park with the flow
I am pro, as you see I'm off the charts with the flow
Actually I'm number one on the charts with the flow
In some places they say this, I am God with the flow
Like my office, but they're biased, too involved with the flow
(Although) I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow
Troubled man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow
I come up hard but I evolve with the flow
Crossover, slam dunk, Rucker Park with the flow

Killer Cali, nigga (same song)
A-T-L (same song)
Real-adelphia.. dude it's all around the world

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
London, England, South of France
And all points between they know about your man
Konichiwa ladies when I'm out in Japan
I'm a Tokyo Giant like Ichiro, I am
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw
Spot me the hotel, the Cap', or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like ""Oui""
Your man'll stand manta ray, handlin' a steak
And handlin' a model, standin' about five-eight
Five-nine, fine wine, fine dine, either that
Or I'm mixin' in Switzerland, tryin' to buy time
Ballin' out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali
Brunchin' at the 4 Seasons, off the heezy
Then it's back home, nigga, back to the zone
Nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me

[Chorus: Jay-Z (LaToiya Williams)]
All around the world.. (same song)
Brooklyn bombers (same song)
Detroit players (same song)
Chi-Town.. all around the world

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Said it's all love, Shore Club, M-I-A
Party at bungalow eight, when I stay
Pool look like a hundred Beyonce's
A couple fiances, I'm the new DeVante
Come and Talk to Me, mami in the Yves Saint
Laurent, I hope, she ain't too young
Only twenty-one and older let another nigga mold her
I'm just tryin' to show her how a baller and a roller
Sleep one place, tell the pilot to keep the engine
Runnin', then I wake up in Martha's Vineyard
St. Bart's this year, I think I'm gon' spend Christmas
Reminiscin' 'bout the time my mom couldn't spend Christmas
Now I'm gon' send her on her own little wish list
Anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl
Forever my lady, blind crippled and crazy
A ticket and your favourite CD - sweet Sade

[Break: LaToiya Williams]
Sade, Sade, don't you know I love you sweet Sade, Sade
All around the world

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Said it ain't where you from yo it's where you at
Real niggas out in Brooklyn, some niggas don't clap
It's real killers out in Cali, some niggas just act
Hollywood like they out the hood, it's all to the good
Real players in the D-Twa, some of them throwed
Slackin' on they mackin', rest haven for hoes
Real pranksters in the Chi, most of them real folks
Disciplined Gangsters, come on Charlie I know
Shit, it ain't about your city or borough
It's 'bout if you really as thorough
And if you are, holla at your boy
I put my hand on my heart, that means I feel you
Real recognize real and you lookin' familiar
I'm a Bed-Stuy nigga but I do it to death
I promise I'm in St. Thomas homie eatin' at Chef's
One-twelve, A-T-L, the sun up yet?
Then we party like the sun don't set

[Outro: LaToiya Williams]
We gon' take you all around the world.. it's the same song (same song)
Everywhere (same song)
It's the same song (same song)
We gon' take you all around the world.. same song (same song)
Same song (same song)
Same song (same song)

Leavin' the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin' 'bout hoes and dough again
Yup! Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin', about the dough I spend
But I was holdin' then, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I bought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rear view
V-12 engine, corners spinnin'
Twinkies shinin', pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma
You see me cruisin' down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first serve basis
You know Hov' be goin' to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin' cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll witcha boy you'll be poppin' tags

[Verse 2: Twista]
It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin' while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin' like a nigga that just came up on a mill'
And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the flo'
Bag full of clothes, I remember havin' rocks in the hall
On the corner with the Glock by the balls
Servin' up a jab and workin' security 6 to 6
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Buy what's on the wall, go ahead and treat yo'self
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
To the lot and lay the paper down and cop that Jag
I got a closet full of ammunition and funds
Mink, Rocawear and some guns, Pelle and a fresh pair of Jordans
Dro packs and Bo Jacks and Air Maxes; throwbacks and 1s
No max for none
(When I go up in the sto' a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be choppin' up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay
Poppin' big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay!

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Uh-huh, whattup? Tell you somethin 'bout me
My throwback game is whiffle wicked
Saint Patties day, green pinstripe, number 20 Mark Spitz'n
Jersey ooh-wee with the matchin New Era fitted
White boys say my style is bitchin', keepin' coke in the kitchen
Keep a Glock that will shock and bring the rest
Tucked underneath my Mitchell & Ness
(HA!) Scramblin', handlin' with a .45 cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside how they felly fell
More G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan, oh man with the gun in hand
I leave your blood squirtin'
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest
Of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fuckin', a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordans and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy speak easy, slight with the fight words
I'll put somethin hot through your motherfuckin' Iceberg
Got a project chica, named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro' reefer
Small, pinkies like that, talk 'til the paper fat
I rock somethin', roll chief Sacks like Daddy Fat!

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Pop tags in reverse, you'll be needin' a nurse
Leave you layin' on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your momma in all black with a matchin' purse
I know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox expectin a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD, that means Movie Date
Dinner Date, Lunch Date, help me please
My sheets is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimpously serve the song
Act a damn donkey
Like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the Indians home
Drop top rag-o with the weed gone
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of FAO Schwartz for the chill'uns
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kiddin'
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
Or are you actin' mad 'cause the money done
Slowed, down, just a lil bit, dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall bull-pit, dead game is the pul-pit
Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin', a miracle happenin'
Jay-Z, Killer Mike and Big Boi rappin' and rhymin' and smabbin'
Pop that tag on some of this game
Holla-tic, swallow and keep the change

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!
And we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin' off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we be poppin' tags, pimpin', we be poppin' tags!",53.9K

Had to check myself, get my mackin' back in perspective

Uhh, just point out the bounce
Uh-huh, show me the bounce, yeah
Just point out the bounce, yeah
Timbo the king, yeah
Young Hov' the king, yeah
Just point out the bounce
Yes, just point out the bounce nigga
Yo, listen

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Rumor has it The Blueprint classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevera
Now it's a whole museum of, Hov MCers
Everybody dupin' the flow, you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like you tryin to make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like - oh shit, he's so handsome
Still in demand in the longest run standin
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin to Canton, I'm now eligible

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga
Uhh, I got y'all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
For those that think Hov' fingers bling bling'n
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is, and single that out
To be the meaning of what he is about
And bein I'm about my business, not minglin' much
Runnin my mouth, that shit kept lingerin'
But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinklin'
The album width to keep the registers ringin'
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Jeah, you jinglin' baby
See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real OG should
Oh, he's good, no he would never sell out, he's so hood

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga
Uhh, yeah, uhh
Point out the bounce, jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Magazines call me a rock star, girls call me cock star
Billboard, pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-Town go-gettin' pimps, we mobsters
Gingerbread Man even said, ""You're a monster!""
Yeah, that's how I feel
To be down, you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated R
O.C., OG, Bobby Johnson son
Ask me, ""Ray Ray, is that yo' car?""
I seen MTV, I know who you are
You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas?
I did take over the game, brought back the soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum to go, yeah that's the flow
All I, know, I gots to blow
And I don't play pause I'm from Chicago

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
Point out the bounce, I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R.O.C
Point out the bounce, Timbo the king nigga

The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse,I Did It My Way Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-i-did-it-my-way-lyrics,"[Intro: Paul Anka (Jay-Z)]
Now, the end is near (Can you believe this shit Guru?)
So I face (I'm from the hood man) the final curtain
(No the REAL hood the hood, not the RAP hood)
(The REAL hood, like three pair of pants)
My friends, I'll say it clear (pair of sneakers)
(My moms is bustin' her ass) State my case
(Nigga I'm goin' to Japan tomorrow!) Which I'm certain
(You understand what I'm sayin'? Can you believe that?)
I lived a life that's full (They have people, waitin'
At the airport like five days like I'm a Beatle or somethin')
(That's really somethin'!) And I traveled each, and every highway
(Seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more
Much more than this (still here) I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
(Let's try this one, uhh, yeah!)

[Break: Jay-Z (Paul Anka sample)]
Gangsta nigga
Put my hustle down, tore the game up, nigga
Took your high score down, put my name up, nigga
Tore the doors down to the Hall of Fame is Jigga
I did it my way (and more.. much more than this)
That's right, it's a beautiful thing man!
(I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy) I did it my way -- Hovi baby!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas
Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform
Pop hurtin' assertive, flirted with death
Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
Grandma's favorite, she could not understand
How there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor
Has to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse
As a reminder that I make top paper?
Black entrepreneur, nobody did us no favors
Nobody gave us shit, we made us
The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis
Biggs the smart one on the low like Dean Martin
We came in this game, not beggin' niggas pardon
Demandin' y'all respect, hand over a check
And while y'all at it, hand over the jet
We the reason they ain't hand over Def Jam so quick
They knew every year I was droppin' new product
I was raisin' the stock up, while buildin' the Roc up
But that's alright, 'cause they knew they had to see us
When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-aires
Je-je-jeah!

[Chorus: Paul Anka sample]
And more, much more than this; I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Jeah! In my lifetime
I caught smaller cases, but I had capital
Hypocritical system let me right back at you
You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude
They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
And they can look good by paintin' him as bad news
'Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views
Exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
So imagine how disturbed I was
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
Let me explain exactly how this shit was
This nigga Un yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin
But it’s cool 'cause we back friends, it happened and it's over
It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to bein' Hova
Maybach with the chauffeur, laid back
Helicopter seat, feet inclined, shit feelin' like a sofa
Helicopter meet me, Teterboro take me over
Somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speakin' to vultures
So the next time that page six approaches us
Here's a quote from Jay, nigga I did it my - way

Young is eternal, my youngins'll burn you

You put on two tube socks, you couldn't walk in my shoes
I was dealt a bad hand, fuck what else could I do
But keep somethin' up my sleeve that'll help me through
But can you believe, everywhere I'm at, models come through
Cat-fightin', cat-walkin', it happens often
It's true how society don't want me to move
Into the penthouse building with spectacular views
They're like uhh, ""He's a menace he could never be a tenant""
I'm like ooh, what's a young nigga to do?
I bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that I don't
Give a fuck we just chillin' watchin' chandelier ceilings high as fuck
Old lady, don't blow my high
'specially if you don't know my life, don't make me bring
Sharpton in it 'cause I'm dark-skinned-ed or

How so, how Jay get up out that, here, yeah
I snatched purses, I per-se-vered, yeah
I had work, fiends purchased, it was clear
I was out there sellin' hope for despair, but stop there
I swear, I only make good from my mouth to God's ears
Had to get out the hood
And I can't justify genocide
But I was born in the city where the skinny niggas die
Born in the city where the skinny niggas ride
And as a skinny nigga I had beef with high size

Come on
Ha, hey yo stop playing man
This is real serious
Ha (It's the rock) yeah yo
Let's go

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Let's go
Post Positano, Hov' hanging with Bono
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you, too, can cool out poolside at the Delano
If you, too, flow like you was out of your mind yo
'Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonald's
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know
And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who knew estates, throw it away
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now here's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action
They say when you play with skills, good luck could happen

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit
You got it Kris-crossed ain't no turning me backwards
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual, he's criminally attached
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors
By dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to the riches through trafficking
Through rapping and whatever's happening
Rocawear, I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
Every time I get out they put me right back in
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow, I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
In case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon

Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Tote more Guns than Roses, foes is
Visibly shook of the invisible bully (let's go)
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
In order to experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain
You know the saying, somebody's loss is another's gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
Everything evens up, you just wait
Even a garbage can gets a steak
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith
But when it turns your way before it turns away
Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay
You'll get return in your investment if attention you pay, let's go

(I'm not trying to be no big thing, no no)
(I'm not trying to give you no advice)
(I don't claim to be) (no philosopher)
(But I sure know, this is life, baby, baby)

[Intro: Jay-Z (over sample)]
You gotta let this one breathe, Just
Just let it breathe for a second
Yup! Hovi's home!
The newest addition to The Roc, M.O.P
The Blueprint 2 is on its way
I know y'all hear my footsteps out there, I'm coming
Let's go get 'em Just!

[Interlude: Lil' Fame]
Time to dump (fiyah!) dump (fiyah!)
Dump (fiyah!), dump (fiyah!), dump (fiyah!!!)
(You don't know, what you're doing, doing, doing, doing)
It's the M.O.P.!

[Verse 1: Lil Fame]
And the zip code is 1-2-3, and motherfucker we coming
100 miles and gunning, I'm still running with cats that rob
From the era of XL 80's and hatchback Saabs
(SAME GAME!) Operation for this industry lockdown
We still tote hammers that go blak-ow, run up if you wanna
Believe me dawg, these hammers with they owners
Fuck your G up, have ya with blue Pampers in a coma
And your family now moan, look seventy pounds gone
A little fuck, shriveled up with a hospital gown on
(WE HOLDING IT DOWN HOMES!) Keep pushing we fell, bastards
To get over, we prowl with slippery shell tactics
Chippety frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups
Lil' nigglet,, what the fuck you recording for, Nick Jr?
(THE GAME AIN'T CHANGED) it just got harder
Plus we sponsored by Laze, Dame Dash and Mr. S dot Carter
Brownsville (YEP!), we stomp through this bitch all day
Rock with my cock out, face the crowd and piss off stage

[Verse 2: Billy Danze]
I'm from the G side of thangs, where we ride and bang
With a heat that'll flame, that's how we got the name
(WARRIORS!) Embedded in ya brains
And someone should be telling 'em the veterans have came
And we're better in the game, you better make it rain
(27 a gram) My man, it's better than cocaine
Now everything will change and this Family will rule the world
And you haters can eat a dick up 'til you hiccup and earl!
A decade on the grind, nigga I paid mine
So it's my time to shine and for you to ride the pine
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb-ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young-ass kids (M.O.P.)
The O.G.'s repped and survived around this motherfucker
(FIRST FAMILY!) We kept it live around this motherfucker
When it's crunch time, we do it our wizzay
Fo' shizzle my nigga, learned to grip pistols in B.K

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Turn my music high, high, high, high-er

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Mo' fire, more Rocawear attire
Mo' money, mo' murder now that M.O.P.'s hired
Mo' further for the Roc Empire, y'all won't serve us, y'all nervous
Know them guns on full service, ready to fire
One body, two body, three body, four
Young sitting on paper, I'm above the law
Young shitting on haters, I ain't fucking with y'all
For my Brownsville neighbors, How About Some Hardcore
And it just get worser every time I sign my signature in cursive
Just add another million to these verses
One million, two million, three million, four
And the money's really worthless, I'm pissing you off on purpose
My nephew's situated and my mom is straight
So I'm ready for whatever drama should come my way
And you niggas rapping to me, so your drama is fake
You dudes is noodles, I got more ziti to bake
You dudes is cake, I keep two biscuits on the waist
Razor blades under the tongue, I will eat your face
Appetite for destruction, I am starving today
Got a money hungry lawyer that'll eat the case
And that's just food for thought, don't let it go to waste

The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse,Meet the Parents Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-meet-the-parents-lyrics,"[Intro]
Woo!
Uhh, uhh
It's The Gift and the Curse
Uhh, uhh, yeah
First they love me, then they hate me, then they love me again
They love me again
Let's take a trip down
I gotcha

[Verse]
Let's take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain, grey skies, seems at the end of every
Young black life is this line, ""Damn, him already?
Such a good kid,"" got us pourin' Henn' already
Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above
When it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love
So, give Big a hug, tell Aaliyah I said hi
Till the next time I see her, on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him 'cause, in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn
Poor Isis, that's his mama name
Mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?
Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him
Hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him
Isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him
Damn near impossible, only men can raise men
He was his own man, not even him can save him
He put his faith in a thirty-eight in his waist
But when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate
End up dead before thirty-eight, and umm
That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world
Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away
Isis' life just ended on that rainy day
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed
Down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude
Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew
Angel dust, dipped in WOO!
She slipped into her own fantasy world
Had herself pregnant by a different dude
But reality bites and this is her life
He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife
It was just this night when moon was full
And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight
Had her soundin' like Lisa Lisa, I wonder if I take you home
Will you still love me after this night?
Mike was the hard head from around the way
That she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype
Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
He was a Willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like
It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
But Isis liked this Broadway life
She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red, green, and whites
Hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight
She was so turned on that she had to shower twice
How ironic it would be some fight that
Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life
See, Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene
Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
Sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like
""If that was my son, he would look much different
See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark""
So it's mama's baby, papa's maybe
Mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets (fuck niggas want?)
Had his old reliable thirty-eight gun in his reach
It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak
He runnin' around like life's a peach, 'til one day
He approached this thug that had a mean mug
And it looked so familiar that he called him ""Young Cuz""
Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you)
Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub
He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up)
There was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before
It's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' hisself more mature
And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war
(What's that?) He who hesitates is lost
He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank
The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct
Six shots into his kin, out of the gun
Niggas be a father, you're killin' your son
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons

Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life
Some way, we gotta make it up out this life

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Whether we dribble out this motherfucker
Rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker
Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker
Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker
Some day the cops'll kill a muh'fucker
I don't always wanna be this drug dealing muh'fucker, damn
Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride
Through the sky, I
Used to play the hall and fifth floor, me and my boys
We all poor getting high, I
Seen the worst of the worst, I deserve every blessing
I received I'm from the dirt
I, planted my seed on unfertile land
Myrtle Park, Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand, and
Still I grew, some how I knew that the sun'll shine through, and
Touch my soul, take hold of my hand
Look man, a tree grows in Brooklyn

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Some how some way
I gotta make it up out the hood someday
Some how some way
I gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
Some way, I gotta make it up out this hood someday

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
(To Lil' Nell, Sigel Street, I ain't forget you)
Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck
Nosey neighbors and haters keep they face on stuck
Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up
Moms smoke, kids can't chase the ice cream truck
Girls fighting over rope, the young boys hype things up
Niggas fighting over coke, the young boys light things up
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up
'member Lil' Eddie draw, man how he light mean up
Then they wonder why we light green up
Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't, I lean up
Ain't the L or the reefer that steam up (that steam up)
It's my head and I'm stressed to the point I get a fever
Thinking 'bout the block and all the mothers and kids
That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed 'em
For the rest of their life
Fucking wings, fried vegetable rice (gotta be kidding)
No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night
Our kids eating lunch at night
In their beds all bunched in tight
No less than three or four (you know how it go)
Two by the foot two by the headboard
Man I'm getting scared for them (yeah I know)
That's how I feel for them
And we gotta grip of shorties on the block
All they do is smoke weed and drink forties, cop their quarties
Enough to get the latest ROC, newest Glock, and old Jordies

[Chorus: Beanie Sigel]
Some how some way
We gon' make it up out this hood one day
Some how some way
We gon' make it up out this life, yeah
And some how some way
We gon' make it up out the hood one day
Some way, we gon' make it up out this life

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Right here another lil' story 'bout this clique I claimed
Got another chapter based on how I get that game
Just hanging round my neighborhood, bang my street
Sit and watch the passer-bys play my sweep
South-side, Sunnyside
Is the blocks I run, South Acres, South Park
Nigga all got guns
Over here we got this code Charlie, get that there
We know tomorrow ain't promise so we get that now
Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps
Working inside a smoke house starving to death
Serving these niggas flippers, quarter-ounces and jippers
Agents snapping your picture
Neighbors plotting to get ya
Situations is critic
I was out here be getting it
Living it like a savage 'cause nigga I gotta have it
They holding back on a motherfucker, I'm in it for the haul, dog
Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all y'all
Lord be willing and the creek don't rise
I'ma be a nigga and these streets gon' rise
(Some how some way)
(Some how some way)
I'ma be a nigga and these streets gon' rise
(Some how some way)

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
Some how some way
We gotta make it up out the hood some day
Some way, we gotta make it up out this life

That old fashioned word
It's a word called love
Called looooove
Called looo-oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo-ove

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Oh, this must be the way the nigga Pac felt when he made
Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me
Y'all niggas got me feelin' like all eyes on me, me against the world
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit
Thought niggas would appreciate what I did to this game
Being that I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggas would appreciate what I came and did
Since ninety-six, every year
Something must be seriously wrong with the world
I know y'all ain't hating

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (sample)]
(Some people hate) Don't tell me niggas is hating
(Some people hate) Uhh, nah, you know what I think?
(Some people hate) I think...
(I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind
Y'all got me on my shit

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Raw, rough and rugged, when addressing the mass public
My attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it
Got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck being famous, I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter, my success in this game
Is sort of like Pro-jectic Justice
A payment for brushes with police officers
A peace offering from the Gods for the streets I was tossed in
Til I'm deceased in a coffin
I'ma be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon change the numbers
It's the strengthening of chain among us
Please we ain't afraid of none of ya's; who want it with us?
Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (sample)]
(Some people hate) Yeah
(Some people hate) Uh, uh, uh
(Some people hate) Yeah! You know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I guess it's just the penalty of leadership
I guess I'm what niggas wanna be and shit
Or niggas just bored wanna be in shit
'Fore they get to rappin', start believing it, think they Ali and shit
I roll with the punches so I survive
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise, surprise
They try to take me out the game but I's alive
It's like a old Negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
You bastards know me, the one and only
Big homie from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life
It's either that or y'all gon' make me
Put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (sample)]
(Some people hate)
(I know nigga's ain't hating man, let me find out)
(Some people hate) Jealousy is a weak emotion, man
(Some people kill their brothers)
C'mon man, be stronger than that.. you know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) You'll be alright though

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Au contraire, nigga, I am here 'cause I earned this shit
By riding out when niggas had learners' permit
We bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
I bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out
Turn your six, I laid back in the Maybach
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggas from way back
Niggas wanna clown, but the pound, it don't play that
Get yourself found drowned where the lake at
Run up on 'em notoriously, take that, take that
And then we coming where your wake at
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that
Face facts, fake rap cats
Can't take back what I took back to the Brook, look

[Outro: Sample]
Some people hate
Some people hate
Some people kill their brothers
I think they've lost their minds

What, y'all niggas get front page articles?
Y'all mention JAY-Z name?
(This thing on?) JAY-Z, JAY-Z
(Check) In JAY-Z news
I understand what y'all tryin' to do
I brought the flutes this time, though (Check)
Unleash the flutes on 'em, Guru
Give me some more music in the headphone
Let's get to the proceedings preceding this evening
Let's do this thing (let's do it right this time)
C'mon!

[Verse 1]
H-O-V-A
I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
Naw, naw, don't be afraid
Y'all and your articles hock spit at Jay
Y'all from afar threw darts my way
What you thought, I would not have nothin' to say? Nope!
Y'all fell into the booby trap
I set the trap just to see dude react, and now
And now you's can't leave
You opened the door, God, I'm at you annually
And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is
But you can't give cred to anything dude says
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head
Shorty, it's time to wake up the dead
You sound a little naive in them articles that I read

[Verse 2]
Can't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of T.D. Jakes
Prophesizin' on your CD's and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith?
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line (It's real)
Donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed in myself?
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help
They call me this misogynist
But they don't call me the dude to take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics, depositin' checks
They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip (Yap, yap, yap)
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
'Cause the nigga wear a kufi, it don't mean that he bright
'Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write (The fuck is you sayin'?)
Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic?
Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty owe you for ice?
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, for even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that, though (Ha ha)
Savin' me the hassle of speakin' to half of these assholes
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov'
I get the spoils 'cause the victor is me (Me, nigga!)
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
You street dreamin', all y'all niggas livin' through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgettin' you emcee
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob – listen, God, you a flea
And the little homie Jungle is a garden to me
What's the problem, B? You not as hard as me
Nigga, hard as we, nigga, R-O-C, nigga
That's why they follow me
They feel my pain and my agony, nigga
I won't rest 'til you on one knee
You want war, then it's war it's gon' be, nigga
Until you on one knee
You want war, then it's war it's gon' be, nigga

Tryin to find a little hon for some one-night love
'Stead you got another nigga all up in your mug
You make me uncomfortable thug, go thatta-way!
And kill the ice grill holmes
'Cause I keep enough heat to melt that away
I came in some sweats, I came to get met
Tryin' to find a chick that make it hard for me to ""next!""
We exit stage left, hop in her Lexus
Treat me like a baby, mouth on her breast-es

Yeah yeah yeah I know you rap and your sister spit too
You been callin' the office and you can't get through
I understand all that, but now ain't the time

And all you thugs with your war stories startin' to bore me
I ain't tryin' to hear about your guts and glory
I'm tryin' to hear B.I.G. and some cuts from N.O.R.E

Mean green out the money machine
I'm not done! I'm Omillio
And interviews thought you could hold Sparks in the hood

And you like it
All those haters talking shit, we don't like it

[Verse 4: Beanie Sigel]
We love it, that black mask, black glove shit
Roll up on him—don't budge, bitch
With my Mac (MAC), and my Tec (TEC)
And my vest, just like that
For them niggas thinking Mack Milly not really from the streets
I'm that gallstone trapped in the belly of the beast

[Chorus: Rell & Young Chris]
Those seen here we'll lead you
Forever
And we will not leave you
Never
And our voices will ring (Ring!)
Together
As one

It's young Free!
Move, workin' the wheel, hand jerkin' the V
Busters know if you cross the line, thinkin I'm off my job
But I'm on like Chris when he popped his cuz
Thinkin them slugs'd fly

[Verse 6: Peedi Crakk, with Jay-Z]
Call me P.C.! Tempers spillin', I peel
Look how I'm killin' the wheel
The fitted tilt to the left, the shirt blend with the sweats
Your girls skirts and veils, she undressing, don't stare
Take a picture, nigga, packin' the bills

[Verse 7: Jay-Z]
I'm the one! Young H-O, a game of none
What you think I do to the brain of that dame you brung?
Listen, hon! Twist up one, this is Armi—sip some
It's only 40 proof, it feel like 151 when I'm done!
Make a run with the Roc, rock Air Force 1's
Rock a bun, hide shit in her hair when I come—
Through customs, cops can't bust him
It's Hov, the hustler; I'm having one hell of a run!

[Break: Jay-Z & Young Chris]
And you like it
All those haters talkin' shit, we don't like it

No, we love it, I got a mami with a body
Don't touch it, you can't fuck with
Young Easy, up on the Just Blaze production
You get nothin', we get enough spins
Can't stop us from coppin bottles while we clubbin'
It's the R-O-C forever, tell the public, huh!

Those seen here we'll lead you

The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse,A Ballad for the Fallen Soldier Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-a-ballad-for-the-fallen-soldier-lyrics,"[Intro: Jay-Z]
This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers (this ain't music)
I'm 'bout to show you how a hustlers life (this is life man)
And a soldier's life, parallel
And the one thing they got in common is a mother's pain
(Forget about me for a second)
Picture split screen (forget musicians)
On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block (human beings)
Other side you got the soldier (people) getting ready for boot camp (it's life)
They're both at war
Stay with us

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You lost him mama, the war's calling him
Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them
He's a soldier
Rose through the ranks as the head of your household
Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed ta
Now just remember why he's gone 'til November
It's part of him growing up
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya
Your heart beating so fast speeding his pulse up
Yeah I know it sucks, life ain't all rosebuds
A couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your lumps
Off to boot camp, the worlds facing terror
Bin Laden been happening in Manhattan
Crack was anthrax back then, back when
Police was Al'Qaeda to black men
While I was out there hustling, sinning with no religion
He was off to war killing for a living

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Days turn to nights, nights turn to years
Years turn to, ""How the fuck we make it in here?""
My barracks average couple fights a day
Get you locked in a hole won't see the light of day
And I feel like I'm just writing my life away
I never thought shit could end up quite this way
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run
I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take one
For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living?
I love my niggas more than anything else
This war's about my family, me needing the wealth
You don't understand how useless as men we felt
'Til you become a 5 star general
Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail
P.O.W.'s that's still in the war for real, for real

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams & Jay-Z (Marc Dorsey)]
Your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I've gotta chase it
I'm gon' chase it
And I'm gon' make it, gon' make it
Yeah, your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I'm gonna make it, I'm gon' make it
Even if I gotta chase it
You gotta take it, wooo, yeah

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Mama say prayer your son's becoming a man
This wars taxing to 'em like Uncle Sam
He ain't gon' always make the right choice, understand
Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam
It's death before dishonor
And if he's gone you should honor his memory
Don't cry we all gonna die eventually
But if he's locked in the penitentiary send him some energy
They all winners to me, what's up Emory

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass",15.9K

The homie that's rappin' be the only one that has it

You ain't heard? I push the six when the fives is out
You can't fight me, in the Porsche I'll box you out

We don't drive X5s we give 'em to baby-mammas
Push the big top that shaped like a Kansas chicken snack box

A 360 drop Ferrar', shutdown manhattan
Bucket low, like fuck it, though
Nikes on, daytime, lights on, hell yeah I'm frontin' but you love it, though

Listen man, get a crate, some crack, and some house slippers
A newspaper, look out boy, and get ya chips up
Or get a gun, a mask, an escape route
Some ducktape'll make 'em take you to the house
And ma don't give him nothin', unless he's treatin' you special
Soon he'll get desperate, and go down and bless you
And when he come up for air, with a mouth full of hair
Just grab your coach bag and get the fuck outta there, yeah
(I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS HON)
Look, think big, fuck gettin' your nails done
Think cars, cribs, jewels, some shit for your son
Don't let 'em give you, hard dick and bubble gum
Make him cop the Lex bubble, 2001 hon

Y'all know who it is (He's back)
Young!

[Chorus]
If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with me (Woo), just grind to the bassline (Come on)
Niggas, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside

[Verse 1]
Now what the fuck they gon' do with me?
Got money, got broads, got a crew with me
Real as banana clips, I got a zoo with me
Get down or lay down, nigga, to shoot with me
Now how the fuck they gon' deal with me?
I ain't going nowhere, they gotta deal with me
Got the whole BK ready to kill with me
You scared, motherfucker? Keep it real with me, keep it real with me
Now what the fuck they gon' say to me?
Got to clap, ya mean? All day with me, clap, ya mean?
Don't play with me, clap, ya mean?
Stay with me, don't lose me, y'all
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different
I bought it back for a living
Thirty-three O's on a bitch back like Pippen
Three she can keep for herself and distribute
Thirty-six O's and a ki', you do the addition
Before Mitchell and Ness did it
I was moving birds like a Oriole fitted
I'm Cal Ripken Jr. let's get it

If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab it from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside

Mami, what they gon' say to you?
Got your hair did and your favorite shoes
Tell 'em don't play with you, get 'em away from you
You need a baller like I, call 'em like I
See 'em like, ""Nah""
Move over, y'all amateurs
No, you not balling, that's Pro-Am shit
Oh, stop calling, that's ho-man shit
Stop falling asleep, that's old man shit
I stands up in it like a champ up in it
Be up in it so long, get my calls transferred in it
No more minute man in it
Get my SoundScan, BDS, and Marketing plans in it

If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline

And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Line)

And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside (What they gon' do?)

You got starch in your flow, I flow too many ways
Got a arch in my flow, all sorts of flow
Rembrandt, Rilke, I am art with the flow
Even if I'm guilty, you gotta pardon the flow
Niggas takin' it lightly, had to darken the flow
Way I put it together, tear 'em apart with the flow
I'm too smart with the flow, you just started to flow
Stop it youngin, you 106th & Park with the flow
I am pro, as you see, I'm off the charts with the flow
Actually, I'm number one on the charts with the flow
In some places they say this, I am God with the flow
Like my office, but they're biased, too involved with the flow
Although I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow
Trouble Man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow
I come up hard but I evolve with the flow
Crossover, slam dunk, Rucker Park with the flow (Young)

If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, poke out her backside
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline

Welcome to Jay Z's poetry reading
Halt, who goes there?
Do this, do this {*does poetry snaps, audience follows*}
It was the winter
It was cold
It was the cold winter
Welcome ladies and gentleman once again
As if we never left
It's MTV Unplugged
I'll be your host this evening
I go by a couple of names
People call me a lot of names, couple to my face you know
Sometimes they call me Jay Z
Sometimes they call me Jigga
Sometimes they call me Young Hov
Iceberg, tonight I'm
(H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A)
You gotta love that
(H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A)
I got the most incredible Roots band with me tonight y'all
(H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A)
It's a beautiful thing
Welcome everybody to the 8th Wonder of the world
(H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A)
The flow of the century
Always timeless
(H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A)
Hov
We gonna thank everybody for coming out
(H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A)
You could've been anywhere in the world, you're here with me
I appreciate that
Let's rock

[Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbin' em in the home of the Terrapins, got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
I Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clap that chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Still not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! (Vamoose, son of a bitch!)

[Hook]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Still not guilty y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture
To let them know what ya boy look like when ya boy in that Roadster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging labels for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks

[Hook]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 3]
Hov is back, life stories told through rap
They acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back selling their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
That's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game: the two things that's great
H O V A
(What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy)
Yeah!

[Hook]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

I showed you your first TEC, on tour with Large Professor
Then, I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser

You made it a hot line; I made it a hot song
And you ain't get a coin, homie, you was getting plugged then

Use your (Braaaain!)
You said you've been in this ten
I've been in it five—smarten up, Nas
Four albums in ten years, homie? I can divide

One was (Ehhhh), the other was Illmatic
That's a one-hot-album-every-ten-year average
And that's so (Laaaame!)

I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam
So she call me and maricon
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home
I'm like, ""Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo""
I got this black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talking out her neck, making her fingers snap
She like: ""Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me""
I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
""Ma cherie amour, tu es belle""
Merci, you're fine as ooh but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather
She said: ""all you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken.. damn I'm getting fat
Arroz con pollo, French fries and crepe
An appetite for destruction but I scrape the plate

Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

She like, why you don't buy me Reeboks no more
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick she plays her part
That's my heart
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my from the, hid my by the
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and that walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
Damn she's fine but she parties all the time!
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with that first class seat

[Hook]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, all over the globe
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

[Verse 3]
I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house
A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets me through
Got this weed head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl.. wanna leave me but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
Cause she kept bootlegging my hits
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like: ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like: ""excuse me Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half""
I got this ho that after 12 million sold
Mami's a narcoleptic, always sleeping on Hov
Got to tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow
I've got so many girls across the globe

[Hook]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya

With diamond clusters that I'm freezing
First time they fuss I'm breezing

Better trust and believe em

Til I need a what, til I need to beat it up then it's
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm picking them up
Let em play with the crick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good sex, I'mma break bread
So you can be living it up
Part with nothing, I be fronting

First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov'
What's up? Cats all fed up cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young cats gettin' at me, young rappers spittin' at me
My homie Big predicted this thing exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems""- gotta move carefully
Cause cat hate when you getting money like athletes
Young'ns ice-grilling me, ohh - you not feeling me?
Fine; it cost you nothing - pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for fronting
Sensitive thugs, they all need hugs
Damn little man I'm just trying do me
If the record's two mil you know I'm trying move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, yo I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waiting in the wing but I'm doing my thing
Where's the love?

And then the Fugees gonna break up, now everyday I wake up
Somebody got something to say
What's all the fussing for? Because I'm grubbing more
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
They pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball
Now I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound boy
Look scrapper I got nephews to look after
I'm not looking at you dudes, I'm looking past ya
I thought I told you cats I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in '96
That I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz
I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham but the only thing running is numbers fam
Jigga held you down 6 summers; damn, where's the love?

Ok I feel you ma, I said where's the love?

To driving some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For dropping some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock fleeing the murder scene
You know me well...
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all know me to fail? Nuh uh
Where all my brother with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mama rub on your hips, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh

I keep you fresher than the next chick
No need for you to ever sweat the next chick
With speed, I make the best chick see the exit indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, no driver
You got your own 2001 to ride in
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving, shit, the first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
Have more chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still pounding in my after life
Laughing, my thing is tight

Ok
Alright
Hey
This song right there
Was off the first album I ever made
It's called Reasonable Doubt
Also was fortunate enough to be blessed by the presence of
The Queen of, just the Queen man
I wanna say R&B, I wanna say hip hop
Her name is Ms Mary J. Blige
Mary!
Let me get all the way up beside you girl
You ready?
(What I'm ready)
I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
I just had to test y'all

[Verse 1]
I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter
Y'all can't fade me, chrome stocks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Player's is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any player intervening with the sound of my money machining
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best player's that done it
Six digits and running, y'all dudes don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco

Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching four lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
While I play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
Until legs spread like germs
I got extensive with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know

Cause you can't knock the hustle

But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?

Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle

Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what

Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though you know I gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We should've been together having Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
Now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view because you held no punches
Still, I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
I'm somewhere in a small town, locking the mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside, you know I'm so sick, right?

I can't see it coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

On repeat, the CD of BIG's ""Me and My Chick""
Watching Bonnie and Clyde, pretending to be that sh—
Empty gun in your hand, saying, ""Let me see that clip""
Shopping sprees, pull out that Visa quick
You know I got very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V-dot-6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped
Or rather, mines, I don't know what made me leave that sh—
Made me speed that quick; let me see... that's it
It was the cheese, helping chickens get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now, they saying they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then, I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
Then it got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you, you, you, you

Can't see it coming down my eyes

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home that you got a special friend
So what was oh-so-special, then?
You have given away without getting at me
That's your fault! How many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga living was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Look, I'm a man with pride, you don't do sh— like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had just like that
I was flirting with them girls, I was gon' get right back

But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I mourn forever
Man, I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever

Oh yeah, I see it coming down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it coming down my eyes
But I gotta make the song cry

[Interlude: Jay Z]
Let's break it down
This song right here is for real, for all the hustlers, right?
Had a girlfriend...
And, uh... he started off
Their whole relationship started off, you know...
He did what he had to do for them, you know what I mean?
But along the way, he got lost
Fast cars, fast money, you know the lifestyle
Trust me, he's right here
Alright
Do believe it, on the real son
Ugh, yeah

[Hook: Jay-Z & Jaguar Wright]
Can't see it coming down my eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
Can't see it coming down my eyes
But I gotta make this song cry
Oh yeah, I see 'em coming down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't it coming down my eyes
But I gotta make the song cry

[Outro: Jay-Z & Jaguar Wright]
Cry (Ugh, ugh)
Oh, whoa, whoa (Ugh)
I said I love you (Ugh)
I said I needed you (Ugh)
Oh, oh, ooh

[Intro to Next Song: Jay-Z]
Alright let's get it all the way to ten, where my man Dame

Now I just wanna love you, (You know I love you)
But be who I am, (you know you love me)
And with all this cash

Now give it to me
(Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)
But don't fool with me
(C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff)

[Verse 1]
When the Remy's in the system, ain't no tellin

I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin, I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Crist', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all...""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth Mart jeans, take that off

[Hook 2]
Give it to me

But don't bullshit me

Yeah, save the narrative, you savin it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you savin it for carats
You wanna see how far I'mma go
How, much I'mma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Crist', (but that about it)
Might light your wrist, (but that about it)
OK, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice
Know how to work your hips and your priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's sold
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me

[Hook]
Give it to me

Cause the boy got more 6's than first grade
The crib got, killer views and square feet
You have to film MTV Cribs for a week
So, sleep if you need to, mami I will leave you
Right where you stand, nah I don't wanna dance

MTV Unplugged,People Talkin' Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-people-talkin-lyrics,"[Sample]
[Its like finding feathers on a housecat]

(Jay-Z)
Lemme take yall somewhere else right now

[It's like searching for a needle in a haystack]

Lemme get y'all to zone out wit' me, man
(Its a'ight, don't be scared)
Take y'all niggas left and center (zone out wit')
Bullshit

[Hook: Sample x2]
I hear the people talk (I hear y'all)
Whistling when you walk (Y'all hear me)
Your kind is hard to find
Darling, I'm glad you're mine

(Jay-Z talking during chorus)
Y'all niggas should twist up sumthin
Real real real tight right here
Zone out wit' ya boy
If you don't smoke, grab you something to drink
Mix it up right
If you don't smoke or drink
Man, just light up an inscense
Fuck it
Close ya eyes... Vibe wit' a nigga
I want y'all to really hear me

[Verse]
I speak through music, I reach you dudes
We can get deeper in the dirt than cleat shoes
I refuse to lose
I peep you creeps three months in advance
I SEE RIGHT THROUGH YA, JUDAS!
The man that I am and damn you don't know
The harder you go at me the harder I flow
Let's do this
I'm just a mirror reflectin' your image
The minute you switch up your face I pick up the pace
There's nothin' to it
Pull hammers from my waist
We can clap at this amateur pace
If that's what's crackin'
Or we can play this on ""All Madden""
Can you even fathom not havin' a fear in the world
I'm cool in my afterlife
If I'm readin' these chapters right
Please what have you, I breeze through Matthews
Bleed if I have to, you cowards die a thousand deaths
Fake fucks face-down on your housing steps
Are y'all even gettin' this message?
I ain't bein' aggressive
But if you testin' my life then, shit, I gotta answer
Gotta cut off the cancer, young'n, pull your pants up
You gettin' too big for ya britches
You fuckin' wit' a dude that did it wit' digits
Breathing's a privilege
Don't you know when you're defeated?
Won't you though? Throw in the towel
I'm better with vowels
I'm a man of principles; damn-near invincible
In my own mind now that my soul's aligned
I didn't know before now my role's defined:
Take hold and control what's mine
Come and get me!
Come and take my life, you comin' wit me
Come and try to take me for granted
I'll take you off this planet
Dammit, man this is the gift from God
This ain't happenstance
And your arms are too short to box
Plus we knuckle up unorthodox
You can't take me off my grind, get off my cock
Whatchu thought? It's the Roc

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Back in the mix of the scuffle
Since '86 I was sick with the hustle (Woo!)
Get a couple of chicks to touch you (Woo!)

Thought I was playin' but you niggas'll stop now
I ain't gotta sell another record in my life

See y'all in November (Oh shit!)

[Intro]
Uh-huh uhh, uhh, uh-uhh
Uh-huh uhh, uhh, uhh
Wooo! Wooo! Wooo! Wooo!
I, am, back, niggas
Ha ha ha ha ha.. uh-oh, uh-oh - wooo!
Ladies and gentlemen -- H, to the Izzo
I wanna thank everybody out there for they purchase
I surely appreciate it - woo!
What you about to witness is my thoughts
Just my thoughts, man—right or wrong
Just what I was feelin' at the time, uhh
You ever felt like this, vibe with me
Walk with a nigga, man, just vibe with me

[Verse 1]
Yo, gather round hustlers—that's if you still livin'
And get on down to that ol' Jig rhythm
Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison
A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high
I, Young 'Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers - I'm back, motherfuckers
Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns
Y'all can't fuck with Hov', what type of X y'all on?
I got great lawyers for cops so dress warm
Charges don't stick to dude, he's Teflon
I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred
I'm not guilty, now gimme back my bread
Mr. District Attorney, I'm not sure if they told you
I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to?
Plus - Hov' don't run, Hov' stand and fight
Hov' a soldier, Hov' been fightin' all his life so
What could you do to me? It's not new to me
Sue me? Fuck you, what's a couple dollars to me?
But you will respect me, simple as that
Or I got no problem goin' back
I'm representin' for the seat where Rosa Parks sat
Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The ruler's back

[Interlude]
Uhh, uh-huh uhh uhh
I, am, BACK, niggas - woo! woo! woo! woo!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn the motherfuckin' music up
The ruler's back
I, am, back, niggas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, in these times—well, at least to me
There's a lot of rappers out there tryin' to sound like Jay-Z
I'll help you out, here's what you do
You gonna need a wide lens 'cause that's a VER' big shoe
And you got a couple of beans and you don't have a clue?
You situation is bleek, I'ma keep it real 'cause
Fuckin' with me, you gotta drop a mill'
'Cause if you gonna cop somethin' you gotta cop for real
Don't only talk it, walk like it - from the bricks to the booth
I could predict the future like Cleo the psychic
You can't date skee-os and wife it
And you can't sell me bullshit, we know the prices
So what your life is?
We gon' roll 'til the wheels fall off - y'all muh'fuckers check the tires
Off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of that Bentley is a pro

[Interlude]
Uhh, uhh
I, am, back, niggas
Feels good! Ha
Pah, holla at me!
The ruler's back
Yeah.. whoo!
Yeah.. yeah.. yeah..

Now bounce, c'mon, bounce
Uhh, woo! Woo!
Bounce, c'mon, bounce
Uhh, uhh, yeah, yeah
Bounce, c'mon, bounce

Just what I'm feelin' at the time, you know what I mean?

Hey lil soldier, you ain't ready for war
R.O.C. too strong for y'all
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test
Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest
You bringing them boys to men, how them boys gonna win?
This is grown man B.I., get you rolled into triage, bi-atch
Your reach ain't long enough, dunny
Your peeps ain't strong enough, fucker
Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet the navy
Niggas'll kidnap your babies, spit at your lady
We bring knife to fistfight, kill your drama
We kill you motherfucking ants with a sledgehammer
Don't let me do it to you dunny ‘cause I overdo it

Then you dropped ""Shook Ones,"" switched your demeanor
Well, we don't believe you, you need more people
Roc-A-Fella students of the game, we passed the class
‘Cause nobody can read you dudes like we do
Don't let 'em gas you like, ""Jigga is ass and won't clap you""
Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole
No, you're not on my level, get your brakes tweaked

Matter of fact, you had the worst flow on the whole fucking song
But I know: the sun don't shine, then son don't shine

Nigga, you ain't live it, you witnessed it from your folks' pad (Yup)
You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life
I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor (Me! That's who!)
Then I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was using it wrong
(I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me)
You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song (Woo!)
And you ain't get a coin, nigga, you was getting fucked then
I know who I paid, God–Serchlite Publishing
Use your (Brain!)
You've been in this 10, I've been in it five; smarten up, Nas!
Four albums in 10 years, nigga? I could divide
That's one every… let's say two, two of them shits was due
One was ""nah...,"" the other was Illmatic
That's a one-hot-album-every-10-year average
And that's so (Lame)

What, you trying to kick knowledge? (Fuck outta here)
You niggas gonna learn to respect the king

A wise man told me, ""Don't argue with fools""
‘Cause people from a distance can't tell who is who
So stop with that childish shit, nigga, I'm grown
Please leave it alone, don't throw rocks at the throne
Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you

""Please, not Jay, he's not for play""
I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin' and gimmicks
I will end it, all that yappin' be finished

Don't make me expose you to them folks that don't know you

[Intro]
""Ladies and gentlemen
Let's put our hands together for this dynasty!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
To the 8th wonder of the world!
The flow of the century, always timeless: HOV!
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me, I appreciate that, ah""

[Verse 1]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't-born-hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! —Vamoose, son of a bitch!

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let them know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk mo' bucks

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 3]
Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game: the two things that's great
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Je t'adore, JAY-Z, je t'adore
Course I love you... I love all y'all
Hehehe, hehehe, for real

[Chorus: Biz Markie + JAY-Z]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour, yeah

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam
So she call me ""Cabron"", plus ""Maricon""
Said she likes to cook rice, so she likes me home
I'm like, ""Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo""
I got this black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talking out her neck, making her fingers snap
She like, ""Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me""
I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
""Ma cherie amour, tu es belle""
Merci, you're fine as fuck but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather?
She said, ""All you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me, you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken — damn, I'm getting fat
Arroz con pollo, French fries and crepe
An appetite for destruction but I scrape the plate, I love

[Chorus: Q-Tip + JAY-Z]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, uh-huh

Yo, put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya

Girls all over the globe
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll, come on

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, ""Why you don't buy me Reeboks no more?""
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough, she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
God damn, she's fine, but she parties all the time!
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat-back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus, I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first class seat, I love

[Chorus: Slick Rick + JAY-Z]
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house
A hypochondriac who says ""Ouch"" before I whip it out
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through
Got this weed head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl, wanna leave me, but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like, ""Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half""
I got this ho that after 12 million sold
Mami's a narcoleptic, always sleeping on Hov'
Got to tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow
I've got so many girls across the globe, I love

[Verse 1]
Come on the track like duh duh duh-duh
With a throwback jersey and a fitted
Might blow a bag of Hershey in the sidd-ix
Or might take sips of army with a chidd-ick, I'm so sick with it
Lampin' in the Hamptons
The weekends man, the Stan Smith Adidas and the Campus
Or playin' guts on the cruise, Hermès boat shoes
The Izod bucket on, I'm so old school
Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops
Six top model chicks – who is this hot?
J-A, ladies help me say it now
Y-Z, mami why you playin' with me?
Ride with me, get high as me
It's how it's supposed to be, when you rollin' with G's
Hov! Back up in this bitch like whoa
Jigga get this whole shit jumpin' like six-fo's

[Chorus]
(Hov) V is I, and I am him

Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)
And if y'all got love for me I got love for y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)
And if y'all go to war for me I go to war with y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)

[Verse 2]
Hov! And so I breeze through, jeans is Evisu
She's respondin', top is C. Ronson
We in Luan (woo!) gettin' our groove on
Buyin' out the bar, on our way to Spa'
She never seen a hundred on the wrist before
Never seen twenty-two's on the 6 before
I am, killin' 'em out there, they needin' first aid
'Cause the boy got more 6's than first grade
The crib got killer views and square feet
You have to film MTV Cribs for a week
So, sleep if you need to, mami, I will leave you
Right where you stand, nah, I don't wanna dance (I'm good)
I just wanna see what's in your Frankie B pants
Weight is low enough to let your waist show
Top like a rock star, I got a fast car
We can cruise the city, doin' a buck-sixty

[Chorus]
(Hov) V is I, and I am him
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)
Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)

And if y'all go to war for me I go to war with y'all

[Verse 3]
""He did it again!"" – haters no like
But they gotta fuck with it 'cause the flow's so tight
Gnarly dude! I puff Bob Marley, dude
All day like Rastafaris do
Now I'm stuck to the point I could hardly move
You fuckin' up my high, don't bother me, dude
But Red Rover, send your hoes over
She can do WHATEVER, sip somethin' with soda
She can leave WHENEVER, sip somethin' with Hova
We can play HOWEVER, slay bed or sofa
And the prognosis, sex is explosive
Left her with wet bedsheets, nigga, I'm focused

[Intro]
Turn my music high, high, high, higher
You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—
Sure I do

[Verse 1]
I'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and
Bullets'll follow 'em and
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone
Welcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come, you better return 'em
All scars, we earn 'em
All cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it
Was clappin' them flamers before I became famous
For playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless

[Interlude]
I am Hov
You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—
Sure I do

[Verse 2]
I tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin' to get they ones, I'm tryin' to get them M's
One million, two million, three million, four
In just five years, forty million more
You are now lookin' at the forty million boy
I'm rapin' Def Jam 'til I'm the hundred million man

[Interlude]
R-O-C
You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—
That's where you're wrong

[Verse 3]
I came into this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, from grindin' G-packs
Put this shit in motion, ain't no rewindin' me back
Could make 40 off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov' would sell clothin'
Not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them, hah
I smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin' at one smart black boy
Mama ain't raised no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth, motherfucker

[Interlude]
I will not lose
You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—
Put somethin' on it

[Verse 4]
I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in Hell
I am a hustler, baby, I'll sell water to a whale
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states
Cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate, never follow orders, dick face
Get your shit straight, fucker, this is Big Jay

[Outro]
I— hahahaha
You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—
Will not lose, ever

And I won't surrender it with beats by Timbaland
Cállate la boca, my baby
All I want to do is stroke you all crazy
My dick game is vicious, insane at bitches
Mami keep comin' back 'cause mami came vicious
Catch Hov' in the drop, nasty thang, lane switchin'
Once you turn your neck for a sec, your dame's missin'

Got that rap patrol behind, yo: get to runnin'

Oh, push perico if I need to for the Root of Evil
Was born in the belly: that's the way the streets breed you
One life to live - notice you get no sequel
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
6 oohie, jewels drippin', big tooly
I ball for real: y'all niggas is Sam Bowie
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick
M.J., him Jay, fade-away, perfect
I rhyme sicker than every rhyme-spitter
Every crime-nigga that rhyme or touch a mic
Because my mind's quicker
I'm a '88er, '96 to Reasonable Doubt
Temper short; don't take much to squeeze you out
Yeah you shinin', but the only thing you're leavin' out
You're a candle in the sun - that shit don't even out

Hold up; naw muh'fuckers - y'all muh'fuckers
Better run to the post office and get a job, muh'fuckers
Or starve muh'fuckers, 'cause Jay's been the only one

Naw even though y'all hate, I love y'all muh'fuckers

First the Fat Boys break up—now every day I wake up;
Somebody got a problem with Hov
What's up? You niggas all fed up ‘cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young fucks spittin' at me, young rappers gettin' at me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"" – gotta move carefully
‘Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes
Youngins ice-grillin' me — oh, you not feelin' me?
Fine, it cost you nothin', pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for frontin'
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn, little mans, I'm just tryin' do me
If the record's two mil I'm just tryin' move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck, I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas, I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waitin' in the wing, but I'm doin' my thing
Where's the love?

[Hook: Bobby Bland + JAY-Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
And then the Fugees gonna break up
Now everyday I wake up, somebody got somethin' to say
What's all the fuckin' fussin' for?
Because I'm grubbin' more and I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball
Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in '96 that I came to take this shit
And I did handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing runnin' is numbers, fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?

[Hook: Bobby Bland + JAY-Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Fuck; then Richard Pryor gon' and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin' to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait
What, you mad ‘cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Hehehe, and more baggies — why you all aggie?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit; where's the love?
Where's the love?

Lost 92 bricks, had to fall back
Knocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back

Picture all the possibilities
Picture all the possibilities
Sounds like a love song
Sounds like a love song
The most incredible, baby
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view ‘cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me & My Bitch""
Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', ""Let me see that clip!""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see—that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy
And they don't remember that, and I don't remember you

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
Yeah, I've seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I know, I've seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

The whole industry can hate me, I thugged my way through
And all, I, need is a chick that hold a jammy
Like Meth and Mary, like Marvin and Tammi, uhh
Now understands we can't be stopped
From blowin' Swisher Sweets outta candy drops
Like we underground kings, ridin' dirty
A nigga been focused since I said hi to 30 (what up?)
Young niggas, y'all can't hurt me
Better watch and observe me
And learn how to earn better, I burn cheddar
I set fire to your empire
I blow smoke in your face, burn rubber off of rim tires

I got a little two-two, I call her Peggy Sue
When I'm off in the club she fit right in my shoe (wooo!)
Gotta switch her to my waist, just in case (uh huh)
A clown wanna flip, gotta reach for my bitch
Wanna act out a movie, I could give you a clip (buck!)
But no ad-libbin', nigga, stick to the script
Now all, I, need is a high-priced lawyer
'Cause it's foul ways nowadays, everybody saw you
And they comin' to court too, I thought you knew
Can't even steal on a nigga, muh'fuckas will sue
In this time and age, what's a real muh'fucka to do

Y'all whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone (bye bye!)
The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith
Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willie Beamen (hehe hehe)
Any given Sunday gunplay's optional

Now run along wit'cha little-ass hits
Read my rap sheet, nigga: three classics!
Shut your bumba', I got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump
I leave you relaxed in the hospital, lookin' at M*A*S*H for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And I flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps

The Blueprint,Renegade (Ft. Eminem) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-renegade-lyrics,"[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do, through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
""No, he's not around."" Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it—not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah!—That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
‘Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

[Hook: Eminem (& JAY-Z)]

I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat
Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'—

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ugh, right, right, right
Right, right, right, right
Ugh, ugh, ugh
Feel me now, listen—

[Verse]
Momma loved me; Pop left me
Mickey fed me; Annie dressed me
Eric fought me, made me tougher
Love you for that, my nigga, no matter what, bruh
Marcy raised me, and whether right or wrong
Streets gave me all I write in this song
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school
Valencia's boyfriend Volvo had me making moves
Momma raised me; Pop, I miss you
God, help me forgive him; I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears; Annie shampooed my hair
Eric was fly—shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy; I could do no wrong
Years going past fast—let's move along
Kitchen table: that's where I honed my skills
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee
Clark sought me out; Dame believed
Primo laced me; Ski did, too
Reasonable Doubt: classic, shoulda went triple
Momma loved me, Pop left me
Grandma dressed me; plus, she fed me
Banana pudding was in the hood then
Puffing on Ls, drinking pink Champale
Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. spot
Tone, Mike 'Zo and them niggas—V.A.'s locked
Biggs fucked with a nigga—what's up, Hoff'?
Bee-High hated the fact I put rap to the back
Money pouring in; clientele growing now
Birth of my first nephew—time to slow it down
October 21st: Lavelle came to the world
Followed by three more boys and then, a baby girl
Momma loved me; Ti-Ti, Uncle Jay—
Loves you to death; won't let no trouble come your way
Oh— Can't forget my man down in Maryland
He's gone 'til November; how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
And your son, too—it's nothing I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me
Talked to me rudely 'cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black and living a movie, not living by rules
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews
Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say?
Your time is coming: you one hit away
Beans, I ain't trying to change you, just give you some game
To make the transition from the street to the fame
My momma loves me",141.2K
The Blueprint,Breathe Easy (Lyrical Exercise) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-breathe-easy-lyrical-exercise-lyrics,"[Sample]
So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home
You understand? You know, once you memorize a sentence
It's like an exercise

[Intro]
Y'all niggas can't be serious right now
I'm the all time heavyweight champion of flowers
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now:
Best flow, most consistent, realest stories
Most charisma, I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter! Holla!

[Verse 1]
I jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring
That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter, 'round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me ""Hova""
I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds so when the nerds asleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death
And I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (run), pull up in a drop (pull up)
Push up on my money (push up), I'm in great shape dunny (woo!)
I keep jacks jumping, thirty six sets
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats, all white trainers
The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina, Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
The fifth, a dead lift if niggas don't want to get shot
Then y'all niggas better squat, I drop your set for rep
No need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet
Lyrical exercise, y'all niggas ain't tired right?

[Chorus]
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
One, two, three, four, breathe easy

[Verse 2]
Suckers, get your weight up, not your hate up
Jigga man is diesel when I lift the eight up
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy
Your flow is brain on drugs, mines is rap on steroids
I lift every voice when I sing, my ability
Make yours look like an exercise in futility
Bring your squad, biceps, triceps, and quads
We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles
Y'all ain't real, that's y'all Achilles' heel
Same routine when you see me you know the drill
I spot ya, I lift the weight of the watch
Off your arm, remain nice and calm
Put down your things, Trinidad of the game
Know my way around your ring
No matter how many pounds you bring
It sounds like the same old thing
R-O-C is the strongest team, fuckers

[Chorus]
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two

I'm not a one girl's guy... (Real talk for ya, peep game)
Ain't they know it, when it comes to love
I don't lie (we don't lie, man)

Ain't gonna say my nose can't be opened (I may never say never)
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from (too many ladies, ha)

[Pre-Chorus: Jay-Z]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Woo! Who you lovin', who you wanna be huggin'? Heh
Who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin'?
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Now all she does is homework, I give her in house tutorin'
In and out I'm movin' through her student body union
And she, call me ""Professor,"" say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
She said, I ain't no fool I'll make it up in summer school

I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
Now let the people sing
I'm tryin' girls out
Just tryin' girrrrrls out
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Huh, who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'?
Who said what? Why you trippin', girl? Why is you fussin'?
Got this model-slash-actress-slash-part-time waitress
Spend her whole day, she hanging round with part time haters
All they do is dish dirt and put her up on my latest—
Itinerary, but since I tend to vary, see
I tend to carry more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
Tend to hurries in ten places at once (Woo!)
Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh...
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind, girl, and not your heart
And some day, I slow down, but for now, I get around
Like the late Makaveli or Pirelli twenty-inches
Or Caine and O-Dog, stick up tape from Menace
You tell 'em chicks if they must know my business

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Sample)]
I'm tryin' girls out
Just tryin' girrrrrls out
Put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I'm lookin' for a Southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
Chanel under the Louie, Gucci over her booty
Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
Pretty, witty, girly, worldly
One who likes to party but come home early
Light kinda dark, short sorta tall
Slim, kinda thick, I swear I love 'em all
She can cook the coke and got hook up on the license
But she can get you first class seats for coach prices
Isn't this great? My flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Sample)]
I'm tryin' girls out
Just tryin' girrrrrls out
Put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Outro: Sample]
I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie
And the girls respect me for it
Ain't gonna say my no Can't be over
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from
I'm tryin' girls out (Waitin' patiently)
Just tryin' girls out (Until I find the one for me)",92.7K

The theme song to The Sopranos
Plays in the key of life on my mental piano
Got a strange way of seeing life, like
I'm Stevie Wonder with beads under the do-rag
Intuition is there, even when my vision's impaired, yeah
Knowing I can go just switching a spare
On the highway of life, nigga, it's sharp in my sight, oh!
Keen senses ever since I was a teen on the benches
Every time somebody like Ennis was mentioned
I would turn green—me, being in the trenches
Him, living adventurous, not worrying about expenditures
I'm braving temperatures below zero, no hero
No father figure; you gotta pardon a nigga
But I'm starving, my niggas, and the weight loss in my figure
Is starting to darken my heart, 'bout to get to my liver
Watch it, my niggas; I'm trying to be calm but I'm gon' get richer
Through any means with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture
Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures
Only Psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas
Tattooed, so I carry on like I'm nonreligious
Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures
Niggas say it's the dawn, but I'm superstitious
Shit is as dark as it's been, nothing has gone as you predicted
I move with biscuits, stop the heart of niggas acting too suspicious
This is food for thought—you do the dishes!",124.9K

Sigel lock Philly up, Brooklyn is me
Matter-fact, the East Coast—fuck took it from me?
Fourth album, still Jay, still spitting that real shit
Volume 3, still sold more records than Will Smith
Can't call this a comeback, I run rap, the fuck is y'all saying?
Five million? I done that, and I've come back
To do it again! (Uh-huh)
Ex-sinner, Grammy Award winner
Balling repeatedly, highlights on SportsCenter
Please repeat after me—it's only one rule:
I will not lose!",28.8K

Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff

C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, uhh, yeah
When the Remy's in the system, ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck 'em? Will I diss 'em? That's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin', I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Cris', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all!""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Cris'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses (uh-huh)
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion?
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra (okay)
Filth Mart jeans, take that off

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Omillio Sparks]
Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, save the narrative, you saving it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you saving it for carats
You wanna see how far I'ma go
How, much I'ma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Cris', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love to Hov' and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me (c'mon)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Omillio Sparks]
Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me

But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff

The Dynasty: Roc La Familia 2000,Streets Is Talking by JAY-Z & Beanie Sigel Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-and-beanie-sigel-streets-is-talking-lyrics,"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Is he a Blood, is he Crip?
Is he that, is he this?
Did he do it? Y'know, ehh
Look..

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
If I shoot you, I'm brainless
Different toilet, same shit, and I'm sick of explainin' this
I'm waitin' on arraignment, my nigga is the plaintiff
Yeah, I know what you thinkin' - fucked up ain't it?
I shoulda known better, and I planned to
But dog they be takin' me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle
I sat back and watched it, put the Gats back in the closet
They tried to tie my hands like an Iraqi hostage
Let niggas take shots at me, no response
I just flip and, pop my collar like the Fonz
You give a nigga a foot, he'll take you one step beyond
He'll try to play you twice, the third time is the charm
You wanna conversate with the writer of the Qur'an
Or Old Testament, don't test him then
I know what y'all thinkin' dick, pause
Your future's my past, I've been here before
I know when you're schemin', I feel when you plottin'
I got, mental vision, intuition
I know where you goin' I read your mind's navigational system
Everybody whisperin' - pst pst pst ss perspirin'

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
When the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin'
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?
I need to know... geah geah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah...

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin'
And I only use his waist to keep my Glock in
But when shit goes down you know who's doing the poppin'
And if you don't know, guess who's doin' the droppin'
S dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood
Bad move; that's bad news
How many times have I got to prove?
How many loved ones have you got to lose
Before you realize that it's probably true?
Whatever Jigga say, Jigga probably do
Shit, I paid my dues, I made the news
I came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews
And the streets say Jigga can't go back home
You know when I heard that? When I was back home
I'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome
On any Martin Luther, don't part with your future
Don't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya
The answer is simply too dark for the user
And as a snot-nose they said that he got flows
But will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?
'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone
From what the block has spoken, my God
Everybody stressin', who's his baby's moms?
Who he got pregnant, let me tell you, ahh...

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
When the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin'
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?
I need to know... chicka-uh-ah, ah-chk-ah-uh-ah
Chicka-ch-ah, chk-ah-ah-ah
When the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin'
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?
I need to know.. gi-gi-gi, geah yeah uh, yeah yeah uh
Yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I seen my first murder in the hall, if you must know
I lost my Pops when I was eleven, mmm, twelve years old
He's probably somewhere where the liquor is takin' it's toll
But I ain't mad at you dad, holla at your lad!
I grew up pushin' snowflake to niggas that was pro-base
The stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face
All I did was smoke joke, think and drink
Copped 'caine and complained, front row watch game
I seen niggas before me, with a chance to write they own script
Slip up and change the story
I seen young niggas go out in a blaze of glory
Before reachin' puberty, scared a nigga truthfully
I took trips with so much shit in the whip
That if the cops pulled us over the dog'd get sick, SNIFF
Smell me, nigga? The real me, nigga, minus the rumors
Holla if you feel me, nigga

[Verse 4: Beanie Sigel]
The streets is not only watchin' but they talkin' now?
Shit, they got me circlin' the block before I'm parkin' now
Don't get it twisted, I ain't bitchin', I'm just cautious now
Sub, under the parka, extra cartridge now
Hit his click Sig' up you fell at it you're dense
I get word to the street like Bell Atlantic and Sprint
I feel the vibes and I hear the rumors
But fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still in Jumu'ah I know 'stafALLAH
Niggas wanna press me, put my back to the wall
But pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all
To know me's to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this
Fuck you, I got guns like Neo in Matrix
Cross the Family, think Mac's sweet like Karo
Or soft like Play-Doh, get knocked off like Fredo Corleone
They find you with a hole in your dome
I roll with niggas that'll follow you and go to your home
Thought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense
Catch you while you reachin'
Clip you then I cross you then I'm leavin'
Apply full court pressure
Like .44 Taurus get you out of here, pull pressure
To the trigger, bullets fly in three's
You forever rest under bullshit, dirt, lies and leaves
I do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave
Look in my eyes, realize it's Beans
Niggas wanna despise the team; 'til I play head coach
And straight up, divide they team
Trade they man for some pies and a couple of things
'Til the bullet.. ah, motherfuckers!! Yeah..",41.5K

Geah.. whassup?
To all my street niggas, project niggas
Real niggas, worldwide
Let's reflect, everybody got a story
We all ghetto B, here's mine
Geah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
See I was, born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit
I kept arms .38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid
Shit, I'm going through it - mom dukes too
Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is getting too wild
I need to bring some sort calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming ""Don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94, 'bout the year
That Big and Mack dropped and Illmatic rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doing them, I'm still stretching on the block
Like ""Damn, I'ma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphernalia
Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three-time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Trying to figure where your mail is
Guesstimate the weight you selling
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking damn; how my older sister going make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggas thinking what y'all reading in The Source is real
What my life like, you looking at the source, it's real
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
Passing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans
'Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel hell on earth before Allah drop me
I feel the line's drawn here, nutting more can stop me
'Til them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make Mack not act like Beans
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave, dog
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave, dog
I come back in the afterlife
Like fuck it, I done touched hell twice; what's the meaning?

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Life.. yeah.. uhh..
Now as I walk into the studio to do this with Jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, counting our blessings 'cause Brad's two
Praying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Loving your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurting for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losing life; but you can view it like this
God's got open hands homie, he in the midst.. of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be with your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us
This can't be life

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love

We gon' really get to know one another
All you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right
Knahmean? I'm here for you, yo

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Relax yourself, let your conscience be free
You now rollin' with them thugs from the R-O-C
Ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be
But in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game
Cross over to the Roc, make yourself hot
The topic of discussion in every nail shop
It's a secret society, all we ask is trust
And within a week, watch your arm freeze up
Brassiere get right, A to a D cup
Weave get tight, pedicure your feet up
Ears get iced, gear get spiced
From hoodrat to superstar, there's your life
Fuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell
Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel
Say hi to Gucci, Prada as well
Take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself

[Chorus: Rell & Jay-Z]
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta play your part when you're rollin' with the R-O-C

Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
Yo, I'm young Memphis, used to play the apprentice
Now I'm like the teacher, c'mere, let me teach ya
How to play them benches, hold this work in your dentures
How to play it cool when police come to pinch us
Relax mami, let the Belvy flow
Inhale the 'dro, exhale it slow
I could teach you how to roll, teach you 'bout fly kicks
Teach you how to keep your nose up out of my shit
When the beeper goes off, please don't reach
Like you put a ring or spend cheese on Bleek
Get your mind right baby, goin' through mine crazy
When I'm in the shower, *69 me crazy
Track my last call, contact my broad
With a bitch or two, had physical contact in the mall
You got issues {*inhales*} problems you need to iron out
I will, holla, for now you on time out

P-I-M-P-ology
I play you and you pay me
Believe me when I tell you girl I know you a freak
For fuckin' with me, that ain't all you can be
Just put your mind to it you can go real far
I know times gettin' hard on the boulevard
They say, pimpin' is dead (What?), man, pimpin' ain't dead
These hoes just scared and they blind tryin' and dyin' to be led (Mm)
But who's to lead 'em? Talk shit to 'em and beat 'em
Get they mind right and feed 'em
Now I don't need 'em (Uh-uh), but I can do that there
Put on a three-piece suit and Shirley Temple my hair
So I can, feel like a player when I walk in the place (Place)
Got yo' bitch all on my line, and now she up in my face
Is this yo' bitch? Is that yo' bitch? 'Cause if she's not, she mine
She falling for a nigga and I ain't even dropped a line

Eat nigga, let it stick to your ribs

We lost Ty and E, but we still eatin' though
For like a hundred weeks nigga, we gon' run the streets
Til we reach Malik or the date of E's release

Since a young buck, violent as fuck
Wasn't me dog, the high will do it
I used to wild off embalmin' fluid, I sent niggas to the trauma unit
Forty-five or the nine'll do it
I fuck around and have your moms go through it - I'm a beast!
Shit, niggas always wanna ye shit, then they wanna cease shit
When they motherfuckin' peeps hit
But I don't cease nothin', I decease som'un
I fuck around and have you sleepin' underneath som'un
Jigga Man what, Sigel Sigel y'all
Memph Bleek uh, Amil-lion, right

[Verse 4: Amil]
Yo, A to the M-I, feminist
Holding the semi, leave niggas faced with a dilemma
Am I, gon' run or stay, can I
Get away no you can't can't I surrender?
And I, lazy bop, Mercedes hot
In my way through the tunnel like Lady Di

The Dynasty: Roc La Familia 2000,Guilty Until Proven Innocent (Ft. R. Kelly) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-guilty-until-proven-innocent-lyrics,"[Intro: Jay-Z]
I thought this was America people!
Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh?
That's how we working huh? Okay
Before me there was many; after me there will be none
I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playing

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I get it down, anxiously the public can't wait
Niggas had to have it way before it's release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it crunk when I get in the state of mind
That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental Rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggas upsetting my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, trying to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty thou', still riding with toast
I ain't trying to collide with folk
But I don't want folk taking Jigga for joke
I guess you niggas just woke - good morning!

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I see how you coming at me now, I'm cool
I'm not the snitch, I don't go to the cops to get rich
.. I go to the block and pitch
I go with the Glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick
I go with you hard, I ain't gon' stop for shit
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?
Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbing my game
Seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indicted
Got big money, big lawyers to fight it
Just like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in
Y'all all know it, Jigga's a fighter
Plus I'm claustrophobic, back on the streets before you know it
And my word niggas, I heard you niggas
I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers
Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever
B.I.G. is here, the soul of 2Pac hovers - above us

[Chorus: R. Kelly (Jay-Z)]
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. (uhh, I am the one)
What you want from me? Not guilty

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Uhh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch
Got lame bitches trying to fuck with my case
Same lame bitch I bust in her face
Honey just mad I got her fucking replaced
Plus a birthday pass without me even touching my safe
But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick
But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a better bitch
You heard the rhetoric: ""Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?""
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin gon' change
For nothing else, you gotta live with yourself
Try and lie on Hov' 'cause I ride on the road
In what, most would describe as a Rolls
NO, that's that Continental T
The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty

[Chorus: R. Kelly (Jay-Z)]
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
And you wanna charge me, when I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis (I am the one)
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. what you want from me?
Not guilty

[Break: Jay-Z (R. Kelly)]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, I, am, the, one
(Y'all, cats, can't touch me)
Holla!

[Outro: R. Kelly]
So you can't touch me nigga, you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Said Jigga, Kelly, not guilty

Yeah, it's that knock right here
You fuck around not have the right speakers in your system
Your shit be soundin' like this {*funny sounds*}
Big thangs, thick chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four-dot-six Range
Shit mane, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch lames, bitch flip big 'caine

[Verse 1 : Jay-Z]
I givin' 'em whiplash when I'm whippin' the whip fast
Which one? Pick one nigga, I got a sick stash
Continental T's, no tints like I got a thick stack
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it it's so funny
Six-four switches, slam doors on 6's
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
I got money for a room, it's just the fact that I'm trill
Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard
They have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard
They know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad
Spin away, spend a day tryin to pull menage
Just mackin' this gorgeous; sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
Run lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office
'Cause I push black Porsches, Benz's and Jaguars-es
When the rag's off it, gat on my lap, I'm that cautious
Never trust grimy-ass New Yorkers
'Specially when you're sittin on 20's they get nauseous
Standin' in the Azure with white Air Forces

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
You can catch me in the parkin' lot
Hollerin' at bitches, parkin' lot pimpin'
Everyday we be off the chains
Workin' with grain, sittin' on them thangs
Tryin' to find out where them dollars at (dollars at)
So when I holla at you, holla back (holla back)
Everyday we be off the chains
Ain't nothin' different, parkin' lot pimpin'

[Verse 2 : Beanie Sigel]
Holla at me mami! Sigel..
You can catch Mack in the parkin' lot, pimpin' crazy
S-5, Navy 'Cedes, sittin' on 80
That's four dubs, not S-4 dub
Stash box, push Hot Wheel like Matchbox
Bitches wanna push my world, they flash box
160, push my wheel, mash cops
Cause 160 took my wheel to cash drop
Run 60, you Big Will, match cop
Lookin through the rear view and Mack was wylin'
New driver, screwdriver, the cracked steerin' column
Pushin' somethin' stolen, blastin', picture me rollin'
Back then couldn't picture me rulin'
Now the truth different, Mack come through Coupe roof missin'
I'm the truth 'til my fuckin' roof missin'
Mac stay stuck in the Coupe to school pigeons
Feathers gettin' plucked in the truck from loose chickens, listen

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
You can catch me in the parkin' lot
Hollerin' at bitches, parkin' lot pimpin'
Everyday we be off the chains
Workin' with grain, sittin' on them thangs

Yo, ayo I dip dip dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside the Escalade
So I called up, murder to further my parkin' lot pimpin'
Told 'em get the Impala so I can start dippin'
Lay back, seat recline, they notice the hand
Car movin' slow, driven by the invisible man
Everything on the dash, digital and
I got a fast stashbox don't make me spit at you man
In the parkin' lot, where I spark a lot
I come to show my new feet, slide off with a few freaks

Holla! If you real and you know you a G
Holla! Deep in these streets when you pumping that D
Holla! Be in your hood screaming fuck police
Holla! You keep a gun and you bust for beef
Holla! If you real and you know you a G

Niggas say I'm focused now, they know that's my style
But dog, I'm on the block with that coke and a smile
I still got the crack heads I.D
And they know, I collect for the first and fifteenth
I still take cabs to that capsule spot
For them 31 illusions and them purple tops
And the game ain't change, niggas is taught different
I'm raised off one rule, never get caught slipping
That's why I eat, sleep, shit with my gat
Bag up, take a piss, fuck a bitch with my gat
And I done sold it all from crack to marijuana
You can't deny it, I'm in hoods like Time Warner
Beat cop, take away, I keep my shit
They don't know I deliver off the beeps I get
And you snitch ass niggas wanna peep my shit
But I'ma show you how deep into these streets I get

Holla! If you real and you know you a G
Holla! Deep in these streets when you pumping that D
Holla! Be in your hood screaming fuck police
Holla! You keep a gun and you bust for beef

Holla! Deep in these streets when you pumping that D
Holla! Be in your hood screaming fuck police
Holla! You keep a gun and you bust for beef
Holla!

[Verse 2]
See what this game made, and of age I came
And you up and coming rappers know you young to this game
I went from Marcy to Hollywood, I'm back again
I don't need no applaud, to clap again
Let alone, no award, from rap to win
Talk drama, get yourself wrapped up in
Severe head trauma, get beat with the nine llama
Cut your hand off if you fucking with my product
That slayed shit, I'm on the grave shift
We all know fucked up money don't pay rent
You short with my ones, you short one thumb
You can't, come up short where the fuck I'm from
We got, dues to pay, new tools to spray
Who's to say, Bleek won't make news today
You know the Uz'll spray if you refuse to pay
And I move the yay nigga day by day

Holla! Deep in these streets when you pumping that D
Holla! Be in your hood screaming fuck police

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
What's the problem shorty?

[Shorty]
Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me

[Beanie Sigel]
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, ""Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggas don't know a brick from a bite
They keep buying hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life""
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

[Shorty]
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'mma roll with that one

[Jay-Z]
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars

[Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy

Let me holla at somebody real
[Beans] Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, that's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggas who gettin it - DEAD IT
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out
{*click*, *dial tone*}

[Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog

{*click*, *classical type music plays*}
[MDKHN] I know this nigga ain't just put... put me on hold, man! This bullshit-ass elevator music, man
[Beans] Free, pick up line five

[Verse 3: Freeway]
First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (ho!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutching the gas
I know you heard ""Friend or Foe,"" this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dice and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Cause boys want three bundles two streaks and pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler
Pass the number til you're stackin balls
Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more
I take cash or write the check out to F-R
Two E's, that'll be two G's
And forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga

Mmm, you don't understand now because you're cryin', and you hurt
You'll understand soon enough
Soon enough

[Chorus]
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand

[Verse 1]
You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all
Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small
Shit, I watched you mature, nah, this ain't right
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried
Over my right shoulder, I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you likin' a guy
'Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, his pimp'll die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day
It must be sad, though it hurts to say
We could never be a item, don't even like him
You deserve better, this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me
There's better guys out there other than me
(You need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that you know?)
Like a lawyer or a doctor with a Ph.D
Think of how upset your mother and brother would be
If they found that you was huggin' me
My conscience is fuckin' with me

Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand

Now it's too late, we got a little life together
And in my mind I really want you to be my wife forever
But in the physical it's like I'ma be trife forever
A different girl every night forever; told you to leave
But your stubborn and you love him and
No matter what, despite all the fuckin' and the cheatin'
You still won't leave him, now you're grievin'
And I feel bad, believe me
But I'm young and I ain't ready, and this ain't easy
Wasn't fair to tell you to wait, so I told you to skate
You chose not to, now look at the shit we gotta go through
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna fuss
You the mother of my baby
I don't want you to hate me, this is about us
Rather me; I ain't ready to be what you want me to be
And 'cause I love you, I want you to leave, please

You tried to teach me better, but I refused to grow

You said the street claim lives, but I wanted things like
Bling-bling ice; I was wrong in hindsight
Shit, we grew apart, try to blame it on your new spouse
I know it hurt like hell the day you kicked me out
But your house is your house, I ain't respect the rules
I brought crack past your door, beefed with rival crews
And who wants to be the mother of a son who sold drugs?
Co-workers saw me on the corner slingin' Larry Love
Meanwhile, you workin' hard, like 2 or 3 jobs
Tryin' to feed me and my siblings, makin' an honest livin'
Who am I kiddin'? I, call myself easin' the load
I made the load heavy, I need money for commissary
Try to understand, please

[Chorus]
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you

Uh, yeah, mmmm
William H., niggas
Holla, yeah, yo

[Chorus]
That's why I, squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so called gangstas pass
I, squeeze first ask questions last
'Cause when I pull, I always pop, that's why I'm living today

[Verse 1]
Yo, when I meet ya, I heat ya down
When I greet ya, meet ya with pound
Not the handshake, but the kind that make ya demand a wake
The kind that put land over your face
I pop ya, let doctor stitch ya
I-N-F-R-A, will not miss ya
I move light, like my shoes too tight
Leave niggas confused from the day to the night
At night, see the light, when the pistol's sparking
Daytime it gets dark when that pistol barking
I keep cash 'case cops arrest me
'case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me
You shall repent 'fore you spend a red cent
If not you, somebody of close descent
Thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Corey
Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult
Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke
And y'all choke, motherfuckers

[Chorus]
That's why I, squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so called gangstas pass
I, squeeze first ask questions last
'Cause when I pull, I always pop, that's why I'm living today

[Bridge]
Yo, I said thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Corey
Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult
Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke
Thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Corey
Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult
Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke
And y'all choke, niggas

[Chorus]
That's why I, squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so called gangstas pass
I, squeeze first ask questions last
Cause when I pull, I always pop, that's why I'm living today

[Bridge]
Y'all don't understand
I said thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Corey
Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult
Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke
And y'all choke, niggas

[Chorus]
I, squeeze first ask questions last
'Cause when I pull, I always pop, that's why I'm living today

[Verse 2]
See when I'm low on digits, I push blow in a blizzard
I'm a player for real, I post and pivot
Coke distribute, be where the ghostes visit
Where the demons live, shit, my scene is vivid
Squeamish kids, y'all get the fuck outta this verse
It's about to get so obscene in a minute
I seen and live it, I did some things I admit it
Wasn't proud of it, but I was a child, fuck it
Kept a pow tucked in a brown belt
Couldn't sit down, big gun kept sticking my pelvis
Shit, it was either that or be living with Elvis
Niggas is jealous, hell is hot, you heard X
Wanted to tell God that I don't deserve this
Was afraid that he'd tell me I deserve less
My life was nervous, you haven't heard stress
'Til you heard the cries of my mama, me giving her drama
Told her I ain't promised tomorrow, gotta live for the day
And before she could say Jay...
I was out the door, pouch full of raw, a outlaw mentality
Men gotta do men things for men salary
Bad Boy, not Puff or Mike Lowery
Damn B.I.G. woulda been proud of me

Damn
How am I gonna say this shit?
Hey...
Hey, Dad
Yeah, it's your boy
Remember me?
I wanna talk to you, scrap

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
I remember being kicked out the house 'cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crook—just like you
The niggas in the hood was shook? Well they just liked you
'Cause all they said was little Whitey look
I'm just like you, but dog I can't see it at all, shit
We never kicked it at all, we never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dog, you never taught me shit
How to fight, ride a bike, fix a flat, none of that sorts of shit
Nigga you was an abusive pops
Fuck, you left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta teach News to box, gotta teach News to to block
And that ain't the half of it man, I gotta teach News the block
It's about time we have a father to son (nigga sit down)
Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters—nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
I never follow your orders
Nigga you make me sick, pussy, you could... ooh
How you gon' leave these memories in the back of my mind?
I can see it clear as day, you smacking my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young and said that would be mine
You turned me out, the reason why I hit the block
Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hitting shots
Reason why I started getting licked and drinking syrup and skipping court
Gingerbread Man never think of getting caught
Look at your hands, man—damn you fought
Nigga you left my mom
Left us with no good-byes, you left us out to dry
You left us with no letters, notes, no replies (nothing!)
No digits, numbers was unlisted
You left us with some of my loneliest nights
Nigga, some of my hungriest nights
Shit, one of the reasons for years (shit embarrassing)
Damn, we used to think money was white
Yeah you gave us life, like, fruit from a plant
We ain't eat right from them foods from them stamps
And to think, you was my pop, man, I gotta stop... shit

[Chorus: L. Dionne (Beanie Sigel)]
Daddy, where have you been?
(And when you come home, you got us here all alone)
Mommy, where daddy went?
(You always take up for him, always said you'd make up for him)
Mommy, what happened then?
(Who was you cheating on him?
Why he's always beating on you?)
Daddy, where have you been?
(Nigga, you gon' hear me out)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I wanted to walk just like you (remember?)
Wanted to talk just like you (word)
Often momma said I look too much
And I thought just like you (and I'd get happy)
Wanted to drink Miller nips and smoke Newports just like you
But you left me, now I'm going to court just like you
I would say ""my daddy loves me and he'll never go away""
Bullshit, do you even remember December's my birthday?
Do you even remember the tender boy
You turned into a cold young man with one goal and one plan?
Get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one
Always short with the income, always late with the rent
You said that you was coming through, I would stay in the hallway
Always playing the bench (waiting) and that day came and went
FUCK YOU very much, you showed me the worst kind of pain
But I'm stronger and trust me, I will never hurt again
Will never ask mommy ""Why daddy don't love me?
Why is we so poor? Why is life so ugly?
Mommy, why is your eyes puffy?
Please don't cry everything'll be alright
I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light
It's us against the world, we don't need him, right?"" (Right!)
Mommy driving 6's now (yeah), I got riches now (yeah)
I bought a nice home for both of my sisters now
We doing real good, we don't miss you now
See how life twists around, fucker?

[Chorus: L. Dionne (Beanie Sigel)]
Daddy, where have you been?
(And when you come home, you got us here all alone)
Mommy, where daddy went?
(You always take up for him, always said you'd make up for him)
Mommy, what happened then?

Why he's always beating on you?)

Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD
If you like me you reading the credits right now
If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter
I want you to put all your windows down
Zone out, buckle up, let's go

[Verse: Jay-Z]
Hello it's Hova; that's right young'un the wait is over
The new millennium is upon us, the album is here
Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear
Rappers with no relation:
There's ""Seven Degrees of Separation"" and I'm Kevin Bacon
This is the murderer's version
Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
Hova the God, I should be rapping with a turban
Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
Mike Jordan of rap, outside Jay working
Now watch how quickly I drop 50
I don't like playing, niggas can't stick me
Niggas can not jam me, niggas can't get me
Slimmy at the Rucker wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take em out the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe? It's Hova the God

[Outro: Pain In Da Ass]
Makes you think about the people in your life
Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here
He'd say, ""Jay, what's it about? What's life about?
If you don't go through as a man's a man""
He'd say, ""Suck it up, take the fall, do the time
That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are""
How many years you been around this thing of ours?
Commission, 125 years
What's it about?
It's about rules, parameters
You take the beating for the friend you don't lay down
You don't betray who you are, what you are
You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
They don't roar, they don't rap
You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them
You was born to be something I wasn't even supposed to be.. humble
Okay so you humble me now, what you got?
You got a war, you got global war
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now
There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings
There's no feelings for this game
So.. five ten years from now
You're gonna wish there was American Commission
Five ten years from now...
They're gonna miss Jay-Z

[Verse 1]
Career crook, nobody rep Brooklyn like me
Jigga Man, Volume 3, I'm back lookin' like me
Stop the presses, baby girls, drop your dresses
B-K lick a shot for Big Pop' in heaven
Ever since I came through, niggas got the impression
Everything I drop, out of the question, stop the guessin'
It's hot, flows provin' I pack 'cause my dough's movin'
My whole crew up in this muh'fucker
We spray corners, stand there like you got a cape on ya, fine
You'll be wearin' a black suit a long time
I put your crew in hard bottoms
The priest is like, ""God's got him
He never did nuttin' to nobody but them boys shot him""
Brandish iron, outlandish buyin'
Bentley Coupes, not braggin' just simply the truth
We all from the ghetto, only difference, we go back
Back up in D&D on this Primo track, listen

Wednesday's I'm up in Shine, Cheetah's Monday night

She said, ""Jigga-Man you rich, take the du-rag off""
Hit a U-turn, ""Ma I'm droppin' you back off""
Front of the club, ""Jigga why you do that for?""
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend bitch
Won't change for no paper plus I been rich
'88 been hustlin', linen been crushin' 'em
Women been fuckin' 'em, huh?
You see I live for the love of the street
Rap to the ruggedest beats
Hall closet cluttered with heat

Pop bottles on the White House lawn
Guess I'm just the same old Shawn

Niggas see me in the streets with no bodyguards
Just two big guns that'll body your squad
'Cause niggas be schemin' on me, probably are
Think Jigga's a joke, nigga? Hardy har
I spit Brook-Brook-Brooklyn every time I bust
Radio's gotta play me though I cuss too much
Magazines say I'm shallow, I never learned to swim
Still they put me on they cover 'cause I earn for them
Soon as I sell too much, watch them turn on him
'Cause that seem to be the shit that'll earn for them
I spit that murder-murder-murderous every time a verbalist
Iller than Verbal Kint is or O-Dog in Menace

Whole squad buyin' rounds of Cris'
Whole squad got they crowns on wrist
Whole squad got a pound to twist
Whole squad got a pound to spit, in case a clown wanna flip

Then I skated to four, 'fore I went on tour
I came back and it's plain, y'all niggas ain't rappin' the same
Fuck the flow, y'all jackin' our slang

Three cuts in your eyebrows tryin' to wild out

Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse
(This is {bullshit} y'all)
In New York City for the first day in the trial of
(I'm gone) {*car speeds off*}
The State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z
(Uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh)
Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Ayo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice
Or witness to me killin' the track
Testify 'til me spillin' the smack
Now they got me for traffickin', racketeerin', audio crack
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
A broke man, approachin' the bench with intent
To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man
Evidence stemmin' from ninety-six
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix
While they was usin' cut, I was on some other shit
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised
Listenin' to testimony about my foul ways
Exhibit A: Reasonable Doubt
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out

[Interlude: Serena Altschul]
You can feel the tension building here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the trial of the century

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How come, you label your brand of dope
Vol. 1 and spread it through the slums?
Fed it to the young with total disregard
Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge
And how could you, turn right around
And release a lethal dosage called Vol. 2
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise
Known as Roc-A-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise
Of record execs, and do you object?
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons
And we ain't gon' talk about Murder Inc
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link

[Interlude: Serena Altschul]
The State is seeking the maximum penalty
And with the overwhelmin' amount of evidence
The D.A.'s presented, things aren't lookin' good

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man

The rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
In the face of adversity

Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
Keep us spiralin', goin' backwards
At age nine, saw my first hate crime
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine
Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time

[Interlude: Serena Altschul]
While the jury is inside deliberatin'
Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation

It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, bounce)
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so

And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You know the flow sicker, know Jigga, mo' sicker now right
You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like
Crazed and demonic, uh, without blazin' chronic
Product of Reaganomics
You know that motherfuckin' stoop raised me
Ringin' in the hoops but I was too lazy
School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy
Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z
Let me explain this to you, baby
I spent nights out, days in
Niggas was blazing
Twelve noon where I was raised in
I felt caged in but kept roaming
Prayed for the Day of Atonement
Married to the streets no date of annulment
It seems every time it comes up, they postpone it
So I kept my chrome at the waist, waiting for the omen
Savoring the moment and now you know
The reason that I flow the way I flow, baby

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, bounce)
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Exhale breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You know I move like an ounce
Bottled up like crack
That's how I make you bounce like that
Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that
That's why no other rapper got a sound like that
Trap, trap of my life
Flashback, kill niggas
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga Man baby
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it
God given, guess it was all for hard living
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom
Could've been lost in the system
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
I know I must be part of some mission
Shit, I used take it for granted
Why they placed me on this planet
I would ask myself while writin' raps to myself
But right there under my nose
Was the flow of all flows
Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, bounce)
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Exhale breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
You know I've traveled through zones
Homes spazzed like a bad back
I came into this game on Jaz's back
I jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that
Yeah I'm here to show and prove
Don't matter to me the Garden or flowin' on Clue
Whatever niggas wanna do - it's alright with me
Whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy
Dusty or musty, sober or saucy
Broker than Todd Bridges, richer than Bill Cosby
Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?
Past on to the next life and you still haunt me
I'ma keep doing me unfortunately
I make the club rock, make thugs pop guns
Make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son
Shit I give you what's hot and what's not, I never knew
Y'all (niggas) know (niggas) how (niggas) do

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
(Uh, exhale, inhale)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can explain
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Uh, bounce, shake, what? uh-huh)
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
(Uh-huh, inhale, exhale)
And I don't know the way I feel I can explain
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, shake ladies)
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
(Uh-huh, breathe for me, uh, uh-huh)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Lights out niggas)
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
And I don't know the way I feel I can explain
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
And I don't know the way I feel I can explain
I love you

[Verse 1]
Yo, show closer, J-to-the-A-Y-Hovah
Place shutter down, who the fuck'll fuck around?
Game spitter, Range sitter, Bentley driver nigga
Keep a full clip, I have to empty out on niggas
Ho bagger, no slacker, get this shit jumping
Like eight blacks, four crackers, get your ass jumped
Cris' sipper, six dipper, wrist glitter nigga
Gat buster, ass toucher.. clit licker
Go against Jigga your ass is dense
I'm about a dollar, what the fuck is 50 Cents?
Hot shit, kick a nigga, turn these mics out
My jewelry so bright you can turn these lights out
Hova's like Noah keep two in the truck
I'm like U-Haul; every bitch moving I fuck
You move slut, I gotta put two in your butt
I'm everything: the when's, why's, who's, and what
Nigga what?

[Chorus]
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop

[Verse 2]
Separate myself from the lame, no you can't see me
I'm 6-0-0, you 300 C-E
Give my ladies dick, my young hoes pee-pee
Hits in a row like MJ; ""Hee-hee!""
Since I was waist height, late night, busting in the clouds
Running wild, coming home late, cussing out my mouth
Niggas said, ""Bryan leave your cousin in the house""
Every time we play the Dozen, he's bugging out
While y'all was playing yo-yo, I was sitting on low pros
Dipping the po-po, getting that dough-dough
No, no I ain't stupid I take loot kid
What's in the bank? Shoot it
Lose it like I ain't do it
You wanna play Jigga, nigga? What you drank, fluid?
Got a full tank, now you wanna pull rank?
I clap steel, act ill, Jigga shoot thee
Give you chest pains, leg sprains—absolutely! What!

[Chorus]
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop, pop

[Verse 3]
.38 revolve like the sun round the Earth
Try to play hard get you found 'round the dirt
Six shell casings found round your shirt
(Crying) In surround sound from the hearse
Jiggaman, trigger man, hit your man up
Six shots, hit the pole, hit the van up
Kidnap grown folks get them grands up
Timbaland, hot shit, get them hands up

[Chorus]
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch

Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop
Hell no you can't stop it, when it's hot it's hot

Yo, yo
This is for my niggas down in Houston on candy paint
All my niggas in the Dirty South, Miami mayne
All my niggas in the A-T-L throwin' dem bows
All them thugs that send slugs through your clothes; holla at me!
It's for the black culture, Spanish chicks with the sweet chocha
Spanish cats with the keys of coca
All the haters eat a dick, they wanna see you brok-er
I hope the heat stroke ya, the misery is over
All my deep smokers, I hope the leaf choke ya
Hope you'll never be sober, I'ma toast to myself
I hope the Cris' get me, spiralin' into a tizzy
So pissy, swervin' on the road dizzy
May God protect my soul, angels walk with me
First do the flow sickly, niggas is so shifty
The fo'-fo' is like a force field, you won't get me
I brought some folk with me, Brooklyn is loc'n with me

With a dough fetish, the drive to go get it
I like they toes proper, I like they clothes Prada
I like they shoes Gucci, I like new coochie
I fucked a few groupies, in a few hoopties
I got 'em Iceberg shit they thought I knew Snoopy
I cop them Rocawear, my mamis dedicated
They never tell me no, the most they said is ""not here""
I got they ears studded, both wrists baguetted

Too much to sit comfortably, they lappin' up
Who shit is big pimpin'? See the flow different
I drop heavy then I let the four-fifth flip 'em
I keep rappers talkin' to kids, Jigga Sixth Sense'd 'em
Don't mention my name and lames in the same sentence
You see I'm so thorough, take on your whole borough
Be so careful I hear the whistle from the fo'-fo' barrel
Keep the flow Hova; icy neck, cold shoulder

So I have no problem coming around the old way
Sluggin' you, that's what a thug will do

Fronting with the StarTAC ringing in the whip
Icy ears, neck, fingers for years
Got the show wild with the toes out
Shit, I don't fuck with no stingy nigga
I rock Prada, Chanel, and Fendi, nigga
What I'ma do with your little blunts and Henny, nigga?
I'ma Major Coin with a pretty Bentley, nigga
Uh, my niggas will ride for me
You should see all the things they buy for me
Uh, it's obvious how I spend my time
Around ballers all day don't have to spend a dime
Callin' up room service when it's dinner time
Get my tan on in the tropics in the winter time nigga, uh, uh, uh

Spend that dough, when in doubt, take that trip
She ain't living for the moment homie, shake that bitch
He that cool, he can't take you nowhere? Leave that fool
Be that rude if he that cool
Save for what? Ball 'til your days is up
This place is fucked, all type of AIDS and such

Have 'em saying, ""Damn I never seen a watch that blue""
And while they still mesmerized I pop that cooch

Back at you, peep the numbers my album do
They call me Champagne Hova, wake up with a hangover
When y'all think the game's over, do the same thing over

Get a grip bitch, this how I get through life

See Jigga giving dick to every bitch you like

In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts

Let 'em play with the dick in the truck

Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'

Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We doin' big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!

[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T

On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!

[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I hustle from, night to morning, dawn to dusk
Kidnap and robberies like, (c'mon nigga) ""You goin' with us""
I held roundtable meetings so we could go on and discuss
Not only money but all the emotions goin' through us
Why we don't cry when niggas die, that's how the street raised him
Look in the air, say a prayer (hail Mary), hopin' God forgave him
Cop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement
We live dangerous, often findin' ourself in the eyes of strangers
(Who the fuck is you?) My dream is big and in it my team is rich
As seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit
Back to live action, I'm packin', I'm still in the mix
Like new hits, I think I'm goin' over your head a lil' bit
But I let you know I changed names when I roam through town
Stay free and be who I'm professional known as now
Jay-motherfuckin'-Z; and with that said
Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and I ahh

Houses gettin' broken in, quarters gettin' trayed
Bricks gettin' chopped, mom's pots gettin' used

Expensive shoes worn, Louis Vuitton seats, roof gone
Coke cheap, my face is like a coupon
I gotta do Shawn, 'cause even when Jay-Z was lukewarm
I was gettin' my loot on, nigga I'm too strong
Eat 'til the food's gone, they placed me on this earth
The twin brother of Rich Porter, separated at birth
I got the soul of a hustler, quiet noise like a muffler
Fuck with us, walk through the ghetto
See the place that corrupted us
Learn why we buck at the guys that come up with us
Ain't enough bucks for us to split in this shit
Plus ain't nobody lovin' us; and with that said

Follow the life of this reckless minor
At sixteen in the 600, unlicensed driver
Playin', cops and robbers, like shots can't stop us
Flippin' a bird to the choppers (fuck you coppers!)
Buck-thirty on the turns
Reckless abandon, when I'm standin' on this pedal
Hand on my metal, mind is on this time they tryin' to give me
Lord help me, all I ever wanted to be was wealthy or
Somebody to tell me that they felt me
I tried to play the hand you dealt me
But you gave me five funnies an' shit

Nothin' less than a 520; and with that said

I remove your roof nigga let the sun shine in
Thirty-eight waist, enough to put one nine in
Really a thirty-six without the gun I'm thin
But when the gat is tucked, I'm fat as fuck
Ignorant bastard, I'm takin' it back to day one
No kids, but trust me I know how to raise a gun
For niggas that think I spend my days in the sun
Well here's the shock of your life, the Glock not the mic
Homie I'm not into hype; trust me, I'm still street
You still fuckin' up then trust me I still creep
Yeah I know the platinum chain be lookin' real sweet
But reach and I bury niggas sixty feet deep
S dot Carter turn rappers into martyrs
Separate fathers from their daughters, why bother
I'm a crook like you, I took like you
I disobeyed the law, threw out the book like you
How dare you look at Jigga like I'm shook like who
I keep the fifth with me nigga, come and get me..

Yo, the summer's 'bout to get hot
Niggas home from jail and they plottin'
Heard about the watch, the Bentley hard-top
The Continental T, got 'em resentin' me
God I work hard, please don't envy me
I paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard
I can recall a year ago I almost lost this job
All y'all remember is the part about me parkin' the hard
What about all them days I was walkin' my dogs
Barkin' at broads, but they never hollered back
And if they did all they said was, ""Where them dollars at?""
Imagine, bein' skinny growin' up around brolic cats
The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats
Until I got a gat and loudly start poppin' back
Round the way, niggas called me Bobby Boucher
Now all I hear is whispers of what you gon' do to Jay
How y'all gon' stick me up, take my jewels away
Pull out your gat, car jack me, take my cruise away
Well I got news for y'all fools today, hey..

I made it so, you could say Marcy and it was all good
I ain't crossover I brought the suburbs to the hood
Made 'em relate to your struggle, told 'em 'bout your hustle
Went on MTV with do-rags, I made them love you
You know normally them people wouldn't be fuckin' witchu
'Til I made 'em understand why you do what you do
I expected to hear, ""Jay, if it wasn't for you..""
But instead, all I hear is buzzin' in your crew
How y'all schemin', tryin' to get accustomed to my moves
So y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house
But I got pride I'm a nigga first
I gotta cock back and pull the trigger first
That's how Jigga work
The funny thing; I represent y'all every time I spit a verse
And that's the shit that hurts
But hey, I got my mind right, got my nine right here
So when y'all feel that the time is right..

Ayo yo, ayo yo
It's only fair that I warn ya, rap's my new hustle
I'm treatin' it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna
My game change but my mind-frame remains the same
I gotta protect what's mine
Shit I started from nothin'; zero, zip
I made my way hustlin', I don't owe niggas shit
I'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped
Cats I played skelly with? Niggas done flipped
I keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip
Two in the stash, one come up when I shift
I keep one under the chair where I sit
I even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch
Ask Biggs; every time he'd come to my crib
He'd find another gun that I hid
I'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is
Everyday like a hundred-and-six... shit...

This is educated thug MU-SIC, niggas

Life's a battle, mean streets eat you alive
Blocks'll have you, tryin' to maintain your course
Through the potholes and gravel
Hot holes and what-have-you, tryin' to clock dough
Foes tryin' to pop shots through you by code
Pigs tryin' to grab you and lock up your soul
Through the Hot Apple, nighttime shots crackle
(Bucka bucka bucka) fiends tryin' to gaffle you
Not only coke heads but the Feds in the Mercury Topaz
After you, up the avenue
Tryin' to give you big numbers, you got math to do
Tryin' to make you miss summer, shit, that ain't cool
I caught smaller cases tryin' to get capital
Up against the wall, tryin' to pass through
Ghost-like, hear the cries from the tortured souls
Most nights, I hold my toast tight, and it goes like

Niggas throwin' me shade, but ain't shit sunny
Hot shells only thing niggas could get from me
Cocktails thrown in your livin' room, KA-BOOM!
I'm so confrontational
They shoulda never let me go on probation yo
I'm a hustler, except that..
No correctional facilities can correct that
I took a step back, I viewed myself, seen where my head was at
It's where that dough is homie, gotta get that
Gotta get away, some try but head back
Uhh, street smart niggas got left back
Some died, they left stacks
Me, I ball right, and on top of that I'm dog nice
Jigga been cold as fuck before ice
Not before Christ, but a long fuckin' time
Get your mind right niggas

I looked death in the face years back
I held tears back, I gathered myself and stared back
I'm from where you don't crack, the weak don't live
You gotta bounce back homie, the streets don't give
I take and rape villages, who gon' stop him?
Not Rudy Giuliani, not Hillary Rodham
Still I still pop him
Shit, I grassy knoll and hilltop him, it's all political now
I think big when I spit at you now
Between my dog and the figures, the four gonna get'cha
Between life and death, they killed my spirit
So what little life I got left, y'all can expect me to ball
I empowered myself, teacher said I was a lost cause
'Cause I used to roam them halls
Still I spit knowledge, dropped out of high school, skipped college
Who woulda thought I'd make it ""Big"" like Ms. Wallace?

Who ever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?
Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
Duckin' the plain cops, pushin' endo and 'caine
At the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain
First album, niggas love me 'cause they thought I was poor
Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more
Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin' raw
Skully tilted, pants saggin', damn near touchin' the floor
And I come with doo-rags to your so-called awards
T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all
Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path
A&R's had me feelin' like Moss in the draft
So I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt

Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)
It took short sleeves and lounging to understand
The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you
So I devoted half my time to invest in you
The other half was spent on protecting you
'Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me

I took you from the projects and an abusive pops
From the bottom to the top
The skateboard to the drop
From the nada to the Prada
I got ya like I got ya
From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya
It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow
Soon I spent every dollar, you became my habit
Other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew
The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue
Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my boo
Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too
Cop my jewels twice, like déjà vu
If they ever met in the mall, it was over y'all
Just the way I do, and either way you win

You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch in my Rover man
I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
I'ma pimp her, it's over man
(It's over man, it's over man...)

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch? Why she paging him?
Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Yo, yo, why you home alone, why she out with me?
Room 112, hotel balcony
How she say Jay you can call the house for me?
There's no respect at all
You betta check her dawg
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids
Got your home, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let 'em hear that he'll hurl
It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick
Ain't saving it, unfaithful bitch

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch? Why she paging him?
Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Cool out homie
You betta keep her away from my balling clique
Keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix
From hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks
From cats who order Cris' play the floor with the Knicks
It can only lead to something unfortunate
Hot boy like Jigga Man scorch your bitch
Play the four dot, Jigga Man go first
Then we all rock 'til we all hot
You know the boy from the Roc got them whores on lock
Got the bitches in the smash
Make them drawers drop fast
'Cause we get more cash than the average nigga?
All them hoes like ""Damn, I gotta have this nigga""
'Cause I'ma hot black, how in the hell can you stop that?
You would fuck mine
How the hell can you knock that?
I'm just playing the cards choosenly
Jigga Man, who you supposed to be?

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch? Why she paging him?
Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!

[Verse 4: Twista]
The Jigga and Twista got 'em screaming
Like a demon fiending for the semen
Chrome gleaming like the dome on Keenan
Gone while I'm leanin' smoking
I'm whip it in the stomach
Your bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money
Why you acting so funny?
You know she been flirting while your working
Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain
Poppin' that pussy
Sweatin' till no fluid is left
When I come in the party with Jay we gon' do it to death
You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us 'cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put the dick up inside her
Can't help it if she's in love with a rider

[Bridge: Missy Elliott]
Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch? Why she paging him?
Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!

Uh huh yea, yeah

Come on bring the chorus in

[Chorus: Sample]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from another pop, minus one shot
We Nino and Gee Money, man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty
My nigga High, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that’s right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
That's how we run, when you ain’t around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I know Momma, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
""Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them""
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine

[Chorus: Sample]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red
If you're wrong, my nigga
You're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

Well, I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump
I'm cancer to the Hamptons

Increase the noise pollution, as soon as I land in
Don't even trust uppity white folks
Keep the cannon tuck

Glocks gon' pop, y'all not understandin' much
I hustle for the duckets
Well, now I hustle for the rush, like fuck it baby
I just love it
Chicks now say they like the way I thug it
Since my album dropped, my stock grows like I went public
Ladies I love y'all
But I love my freedom more
I love my niggas, love to see them ball
I love Beans and Bleek
Them niggas like my Peter and Paul

Sorry boys
But all the money in the world couldn't bring me back again
Lay down, lay down
Gonna stretch my mic out in Ponce Funeral Home on Marcy
Always knew I'd make a stop there
But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
The last of the real hustlers, well, maybe not the last
Bleek's gonna be a good rapper
New, improved Jay-Z -- I quit
I'm retiring, ain't enough money in this game to keep me around
Sorry Big, I tried, honest
Can't go with me on this ride though, I'm calling the shots
The bar's closing, where we going to for breakfast?
Roc-A-Fella y'all -- OKAY, I'M RELOADED!

[Bridge]
""Bringing the drama""
""Trying to come up in the game""""Marcy""
""Add a couple of dollar signs to my name""""Roc-A-Fella y'all""
""One of the best!""
""Waiting for my day to come""

[Verse: Memphis Bleek]
Nah this ain't Jigga, it's your lil nigga Bleek
Reporting to these motherfuckers live from the street
Game I peeped those, my mind so advanced
At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes
Peep the steez, I represent for all those
With 28 grams, on a come-up trying to creep the keys
Large niggas told me park the car, keep the keys
Find a hoodrat and creep to Mickey D's
First gun two bullets, niggas know I do pull it
Niggas trying to kill me dog, who wouldn't?
Screw Gooden, I pitch in the PJ's
Lit off the EJ, I split Dutchies with my ring finger
You find a bitch that owe me cream, bring her
Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us
Shit is constant, that's why I pack the
Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense, who wants it?
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall
Man I'm trying to come up on y'all, get one up on y'all
That's why I hustle in these streets from sundown to sunup on y'all
Mama said keep bullshitting they'll kill you dead
One week of this hustling brought a living room set
Went to Tom D's, niggas mad, veins out
Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out
Flashy, fly little nigga
Nosy bitch from the third floor like ""Why little nigga?""
Bitch please, twist the trees
Took a long pull, like bitch to breathe
That's my answer, life's like cancer
And I'm serious

[Intro]
Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 2]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!",441.4K

Come on... life... death...
Here... gone... yo

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
If I should die, don't cry, my niggas
Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Get on, my niggas
When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas
If I should die...

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Don't cry, my niggas, it's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
In the middle of the drought, I flipped pies, my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige, my niggas
I've eluded the coppers, got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Caesar picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Rocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well, hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
Sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right and play
Don't get it twisted like braids, if I'm missed it's okay
But life's short, don't miss a day, uhh

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
If I should die, don't cry, my niggas
Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Get on, my niggas
When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas
If I should die...

[Chorus 2: Wais]
... don't cry, my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Just keep gettin' it on, my niggas
Say word is bond, my niggas

[Verse 2: Wais]
I got a lot to look back on, in '88 got my crack on
Ten years later gettin' my rap on
Gettin' shorties like a thespian
Had an episode with two lesbians, got a fetish for that
Drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks and pulled the root out
Squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts
Been on both coasts, fired all kinds of heat
Probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets
I got de-mands to meet and questions to fulfill
Like is that mystery God real?
And how was Kennedy killed?
I ain't mad, I must've smoked a ton of reefer
Sipped Coronas with Latifah, broke the code of Geneva
I know when I reach the other side I'ma see the
Cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker
Then it's on again, if I could be born again
I live my life through my son
And tell him never have a friend
Just family, reincarnated I'll shorten the time
That I waited to get paid, tell him never be afraid
Niggas hearts pump Kool Aid and yo' blood run thicker
Never shed tears, cry liquor, my nigga

[Chorus 2: Wais]
If I die don't cry, my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Just keep bangin' these songs, my niggas
Say word is bond, my niggas
If I die...

[Chorus 3: Half Dead]
... don't cry my niggas
Just stay gettin' high, my niggas
Don't wonder why, my niggas
When I'm gone live on, my niggas
Just follow my path, my niggas
Say word to Half, my nigga

[Verse 3: Half Dead]
I'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone
Born to live forever through life's struggles
I cut corners and took drastic measures
Seen niggas life expire right in front of me
Time could never mend what these cold streets
Mentally done to me, too often, I close my eyes
And see my own coffin feelin' haunted
Ready to leave this world that I'm lost in
My only chance to see the seeds I lost through abortion
When I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn, keep flossin'
As long as my name lives on what's most important
I'll be down in hell scorchin' preparin' for life
Afterlife still torchin' and blazin' these mics
It'd rain for 40 days and 40 nights
And I'd return on the 3rd like Christ
(Without my physical portion)
My spirit a poltergeist for sure
I'll be back through the Heights tomorrow
Blood over y'all fake niggas door
What you thought, huh?
What you thought, nigga?

[Chorus 3: Half Dead]
If I should die don't cry, my niggas
Just stay gettin' high, my niggas
Don't wonder why, my niggas
When I'm gone live on, my niggas
Just follow my path, my niggas
Say word to Half, my nigga
When I die...

[Chorus 2: Wais]
... don't cry, my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Just keep gettin' it on, my niggas
Say word is bond, my niggas
If I die...

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
... don't cry, my niggas
Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Get on, my niggas
When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas
If I should die...

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I'd tell Big they're still hearin' his songs
Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form
Is everything that's invisible gone?
I need to know, will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
Can I re, veal the game to all the hustlers
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?
Can I puff cigars and drink Cristal?
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
Can I still touch lives, answer their ""whats and whys""
Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?
If I should die... don't cry, my niggas",29.5K

How I bring it to niggas who, probably want it
Keep playing, you gone find me in your lobby blunted

[Refrain: Amil (Jay-Z)]
Nigga what, nigga who?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em up numerous, shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots wanna talk to po-po's, smoke 'em like coco
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshit, Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin' shocked when the fool hit
Oh hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you
But see me I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight, get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side 'til you say, ""Jay-Z, you're too much for me.""

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Got a condo with nothin' but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes invented
So all I do is rap and sex
Imagine how I stroke, see how I was flowin' on my last cassette
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin' a TEC, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Niggas hatin' and shit 'cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're actin' raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your ho, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me 'cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimp—what a tragedy!
She want us to end, 'cause I fucked her friend
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in
I said, ""Shit, there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!""

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (Amil)]
(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize bitch, Jay to the Z

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Got a vendetta even though I been better
Left him in the cold with a thin sweater
Rap niggas on Prozac get the bozack
Niggas threw two at me, I threw fo' back, hold that
Let the dough stack
Way before Biggs had the gold Ac', Dame had the Lex black
Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that
And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at
I suggest that niggas invest in a vest
When I come through with the Glock jet black
You niggas step back
I'm the best at, you know I ain't no apprentice to this
Me and my niggas we invented the shit
I came into the business with this
The Originator, none greater, Jaz-O finish this shit!

[Verse 4: Big Jaz (Jay-Z)]
Better learn, Jaz'll relax that, ever heard of me?
Worldwide Originator say word to me
The population holla certainly
I burn a nigga like a third degree
See me shine so bright
Nigga, I'm my light, runnin' rulin' with rigor and vigor
Nobody bigger than me and my nigga Jigga
You fly-by-nights stop chirpin' B
Heavyweight's light work for me
For the time in this motherfucker ain't nobody hurtin' me
What, cut your face in like surgery
Who the fuck got a VS
Fuckin' BM's on the road
When you had to be in bed at the PM
Need the info, Jaz on the C-N-N
Forever touchin' my work is beginnin', you’re endin'
Nigga your style's no style, my style's hostile
C'mon, faggot nigga, down to take the gun home
The O-RI-GI-NA-TOR
(Can't FUCK with it, can ya?!)

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (Amil)]

Turn the lights all the
Turn the lights all the way down
What, uh-huh yeah
(Uhh)
Come on (GGRRRRRR)
Come on yeah come on

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, yo
J-A-Y, I flow sick
Fuck all y'all haters, blow dick
I spits the game for those that throw bricks
Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks
Sex, murder and mayhem - romance for the street
Only wife of mines is a life of crime
And since, life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests
How can I not flirt with death?
That's life's enigma, long as life's within us
We gon' sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us
Fuck it!
Ice the wrist and raise the price on these niggas
Y'all can't floss on my level
I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter
When I go all the Harlem playas wall my picture
If you get close enough, you can read the scripture
It reads: money, cash, hoes, how real was that nigga? What!

[Chorus: Jay-Z (DMX)]
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uhh!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (c'mon)

Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uhh!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (c'mon)
Money cash hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Flavors robust, platinum and gold touch
Yeah I rap now, fast money done slowed up
Niggas try to stop Jay-Z to no luck
Roc-A-Fella forever, CEO, what! (what?)
Us the villains? Fuck your feelings
While y'all playa hate we in the upper millions
What's the dealings? (huh) It's like New York's been soft
Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings
I'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing
More money, more cash, more chilling
I know they gon' criticize the hook on this song
Like I give a fuck...I'm just a crook on this song
Bed-Stuy Brook-Nam took on the world
Shit, I led a life you can write a book on
Sex, murder and mayhem, romance for the street
Man, and I tell ya, it'll be the best-seller, what!

[Chorus: Jay-Z (DMX)]
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uhh!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (c'mon)
Money cash hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uhh!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (c'mon)
Money cash hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!)

[Verse 3: DMX]
D-M-X and my dogs bite
Jigga, my nigga, rhyme all night
Thugs for life, one night with this rap shit
Let 'em go and I bet they know what'll happen
When we clap shit
Acting like we owe 'em something
Then we show 'em something
Talking greasy, I think they found 'em down the road or something (Wooh) Fucking with a mad man in a bad mood
Is like fucking with a mad dog that wasn't fed food
And the only thing that's stopping him is you (WHAT!)
So the only thing that he'll be dropping is you (WHAT!)
Chopping in two (COME ON!)
Then he drop it to Clue, and the response from the street:
This is one dog that loves raw meat (woo!)
But getting back to, just 'cause I, love my niggas
I shed blood, for my niggas
Let a nigga holla, ""where my niggas?""
All I'ma hear is ""right here my nigga!""

[Chorus: Jay-Z (DMX)]
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uhh!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (c'mon)
Money cash hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!), hoes (WHAT!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!)

[Interlude: Pain In Da Ass]
Okay okay okay, so now the guy's working for Jay-Z
Making hot songs
But any type of trouble he gets in, he runs to Jay-Z
Trouble with the label, he calls Jay-Z
But he still has to come up with Jay-Z's money every week no matter what
Not selling any records, fuck you pay me
Oh you want me in your video, fuck you pay me
No one's coming to your shows huh, fuck you pay me
And then what do you do when you can't borrow another dollar from the label?
You can't sell any singles in the stores?
You light a match....you blow the joint *explosion*",99.3K
Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life,A Week Ago (Ft. Too $hort) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-a-week-ago-lyrics,"[Intro: Jay-Z & Too $hort]
Uh-huh
That's right
It was all good just a week ago
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money.. had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry..
And then my motherfuckin' niggas started snitchin'
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
Beatch!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Growin' up in the hood, just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said: ""Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?""
He said: ""Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home.""
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
Them crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
I said: ""The world don't stop, I got to keep..keep on.""
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
It's on

[Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail
Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill'
I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinkin' I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack
Lookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to lettin' the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said: ""I'm never going back""
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious

[Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling
I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
The same game that make you math could make you die
(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up, like, ""This is my dad?""
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars

[Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Outro: Too $hort]
Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitchin'
We was one step away from takin' this crack money
And recyclin' it through the ghettos
And buildin' back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitchin' on each other
I got partners doin' 15-20
Wouldn'ta been doin' SHIT
If you didn't snitch, beatch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
We'd sure go a lot whole further
Believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house mane
You know I got it
Got it goin' on
We got the money
Ain't got nuthin' to do with crime baby
But I'm recognizin'

Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life,Coming of Age (Da Sequel) (Ft. Memphis Bleek) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-coming-of-age-da-sequel-lyrics,"[Intro: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two
Cocaine whiter now
Operation is sweet
Whole game tighter now
Moving a brick a week
Plus a nigga price is down
We them niggas to see
Time to start the arising now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, ""Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff""
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, ""Jigga, whattup?""

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & (Jay-Z)]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
But had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down
Stay focused, I'm trying to concentrate
But it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached (""Whattup Bleek?"") and I paused

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & Jay-Z]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
Yeah, you done came up (uhh), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (uhh), now it's yo' time to shine (yeah)
Time to change up, no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So 'til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga, we Lex movers, V-12 pushers
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, ""And what?""
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer (woo!)
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennessy
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me
And my aunt saying I need 50, not 60/40
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby
Your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold, nigga, perfect your role, geah

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek, (Jay-Z) & Both]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine (geah, geah)
I done came up (came up), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (game up), now it's yo' time to shine
Time to change up (change up), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a baller, so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low

Gotta get that paper dog
That's right, uhh
Uh-huh uh, yeah, right, yeah
Paper chase y'all, paper chase WHAT? Uh

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z]
Greyhound bitch, stay down bitch
‘Bout to set up shop with Jay, round this bitch
Half a brick of yay, 'bout to lay down this bitch
('Til November?) Nah, I'm here to like May down this bitch
And I'm thinking, I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch
Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch
I'm trying to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch
Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six
Roll the windows down and, wave round this bitch
But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch
Gotta talk to the natives, let 'em know I'm here
For all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters
I got jobs for ya, drop Saabs for ya
More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya
Money propositions hope that's not a prob' for ya
If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (that's right!)

[Chorus: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z]
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta have that grab that paper dog!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that
Gotta get that paper dog
When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I got my two guns, I came to scoop ones
A down ass bitch and she down to click
Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with
And my plan is, not to leave this town 'til I'm rich
Gotta find a nigga selling all them ounces and shit
Tell them get down with the clique or get found in a ditch
See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit
Not to hit em, just to let 'em know the sound of shit
Return later that evening in the club with Fox
And I got the snub nose for those that love to box
I'm in search of them young niggas that hug the block
All day, 'til it's light gray outside
Shoot dice talking shit all day outside
And even when it's hot, they outside
Let em know how its gonna go, Bonnie and Clyde
And ayo, you would want me on your side

[Chorus: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z]
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta have that grab that paper dog!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that
Gotta get that paper dog
When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best
I ain't got it to give, but I got it to test
And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest
Is your time, I gotta move this in a week or less
For the next couple of days I brought out all I possess
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS
Between the driver and the passenger where the TV rest
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed 'em the cream
Picked em up in the afternoons and told 'em some things
You know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens
Yo, never lay your head where you holding them things
Keep the family then your business, nothing goes in between
Never feared no man, put four in his bean
Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?

[Chorus: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z]
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta have that grab that paper dog!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that
Gotta get that paper dog
When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?",14.2K
Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life,"Reservoir Dogs (Ft. Beanie Sigel, The LOX & Sauce Money) Lyrics",https://genius.com/Jay-z-reservoir-dogs-lyrics,"[Intro: Sheek Louch]
Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-A-Fella, LOX, taking the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Yo, ayo, ayo, ayo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it, like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm looking for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight 'til my numbers match the Motorola bids
And walk the streets up in NY like I don't fucking care
If I ain't strapped that means I took 'em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
'Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiing, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, flooding your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted looking at Biggie posted on my wall
Taking shots of Louie 'til I fall
Nutting to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, 'til I swear Big moved
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggas lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mack, I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment building vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walking
Heat from the Larkin, keep on sparking
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparkling
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawking
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not trying to meet the Sergeant, at the precinct
Eating cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killing your pops
You feeling The LOX, nigga, why you grilling The LOX?
If this rap shit don't work niggas still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggas can't deny it
Lot of cats still trying to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm opening up, or headline
Doing the speed limit or pushing red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic
Any nigga ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L-O-X
Ruff Ryder you heard? We got the game mastered

[Interlude: Pain In Da Ass]
I told you the pain was coming
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggas on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me falling off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference? Either way I'm sonning your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggas coming to lose
Something to prove? Spit it, we can have a spray off
I lay off wack niggas and kill 'em on my day off
Ain't nutting for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave, bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a mil stacking nigga who pull quick, still packing
For you Phil Jackson niggas on that Bull shit

[Verse 5: Styles P (Jay-Z)]
I don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lighting 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas
Shooting backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hopping in your casket
'Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spitting, let 'em know the shells hit you
I tell niggas quick, suck dick and get a Glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I Ruff Ryde and pop a fella for Roc-A-Fella
Screaming (what the fuck), spending mozzarella

[Verse 6: Jay-Z]
I know pop you can't stand us 'cause we cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop, I popped up the antenna
Whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like Scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four dot six Range
Shit mayne, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch, flip big 'caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vein to the brain
Muh'fuckas is nodding and throwing up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak, man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money 'til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gon' stop us with your measly asses?
We don't stop at the tolls, we got E-ZPasses, nigga
Multiple cars and divas with D-Classes
Iceberg sweats with I.B. on the elastic
Shit, beatch! What the fuck, ya heard me? Hahahaha
Put some more beat on that joint",60.1K

Yeah, uh-huh, watch this y'all
Uhh, watch this y'all

Huh! Watch this y'all
It's Kid Capri and Jay-Z, come on!
It's Jay-Z and Kid Capri, don't stop, huh-huh!
'Cause I'm like that y'all, yeah
I'm really like that

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
As a young'un, dumb and gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'
My motto is, simply ""I will not lose!""
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors
Still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats
This is, not a game this is not why I came
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life, I shall return

[Chorus: Liz Leite (Jay-Z)]
How tight is your flow? ('Cause I'm like that yo)
How right is your dough? ('Cause I'm like that yo)

I'm a hop skip and a jump from grippin' the pump
Spittin' a couple of curse words, and hittin' you chump
Shit, I get digits in lumps
I'm a motherfuckin' problem, is this what you want?
Overachiever, I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper
I hate the ones that blow up ya beeper
'Cause I, go in deeper, I only bone divas
Impregnate the world when I come through your speakers (ha ha!)
Fuck hot, my records got the fever
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up
I creep up when the beef heats up
Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, 'bout to snooze off
Hatin', 'cause you can't turn the booze off
You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all
I might bark at X, or spit at The LOX
But, other than that, I don't be fuckin' with cats
Just me, Ty and B-High, thug it like that
E, Dame and Biggs, what's fuckin' with that?
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothin' for that
Other than a couple of slugs in ya back (ha ha)
Rappers y'all, runnin' around like I won't gun ya down
Last nigga that fronted, two shots spun him around
Lord, accept this offerin' here's somethin' for your crown (please)
I meant no malice, I just met his challenge and won

Ladies screamin' Jigga you know we needs that, flowin' out like Jees-ass
They ain't seein' me holdin' the mic
So when you like you find MC's so impolite
And me I'm so into nice, got cats on the corner like
Don't me and Jigga be flowin' alike?
Nah, not in your life ain't nobody poppin' like

In the middle of a war rockin' a vest
Who's the illest shorty alive (who?), I confess
I take lye to the chest and I swear to the heaven skies, I bless
The mics until the day I rest, to make you feel what I feel
I'ma try my best, and if you real like I real
You can provide the rest
Everything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the heart
I'm playing my part, stressed out, just about the best out
Any nigga realer than me, is in a messhall with their chest out
Any rapper with less clout, sell more records than me
We extort 'em as soon as they record 'em, Bleek
I made this clear, back when shorty used to braid my hair
On the project stairs, once I drop to a caesar ma I don't need ya
From the block to the hot two-seaters, ya heard?

Check, on the jew-els I blew more money than Latrell, who else?
They don't know you, think they know you too well
You jel like Flubber
I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set
Press you're brakes, Feds wanna investigate
Mr. I don't cop nothing less than eight
And anything involved with my name, regardless of the fame
It's hard, I can't even walk through Harlem again
Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express
My boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress
To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man fuck ya
I should just let you live, right? Negative, I swear
It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife
Close your casket tight, take your last two deep breaths
And pass the mic, to Jay-Z nigga, that's right!

Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh'd up
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up (Ugh)

It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
You can ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke
Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc
It's alright (YEAH), you heard? It's alright, holla back

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
In the middle of a war rockin' a vest
Who's the illest shorty alive (who?), I confess
I take lye to the chest and I swear to the heaven skies, I bless
The mics until the day I rest, to make you feel what I feel
I'ma try my best, and if you real like I real
You can provide the rest
Everything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the heart
I'm playing my part, stressed out, just about the best out
Any nigga realer than me, is in a messhall with their chest out
Any rapper with less clout, sell more records than me
We extort 'em as soon as they record 'em, Bleek
I made this clear, back when shorty used to braid my hair
On the project stairs, once I drop to a caesar ma I don't need ya
From the block to the hot two-seaters, ya heard?

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Memphis Bleek)]
Geah, now we can
Bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball
Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
You can ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke
Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc
It's alright (YEAH), you heard? It's alright

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Check, on the jew-els I blew more money than Latrell, who else?
They don't know you, think they know you too well
You jel like Flubber
I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set
Press you're brakes, Feds wanna investigate
Mr. I don't cop nothing less than eight
And anything involved with my name, regardless of the fame
It's hard, I can't even walk through Harlem again
Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express
My boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress
To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man fuck ya
I should just let you live, right? Negative, I swear
It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife
Close your casket tight, take your last two deep breaths
And pass the mic, to Jay-Z nigga, that's right!

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Now we can bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball
Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
We can ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke
Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
We can bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball
Play if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss
It's alright, you heard? It's alright
We can ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke
Kill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc
It's alright, you heard me? It's alright, then holla back",15.4K

Uh huh uh, geah
Roc-A-Fella y'all
Jigga, Rell, '98 edition
This is Roc-A-Fella for life, this is Roc-A-Fella for life
Uhh, this is Roc-A-Fella for life, this is Roc-A-Fella for life

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I play my parts with the honies hard
It's gotten even worse now that the money's washed
Like a letter y'all, the nine-eight find me straight
Good health, can't complain about my financial state
What else? I guess tomorrow knows
I run through chicks like borrowed clothes
I'm the type of nigga your father oppose, never test Jay
You follow the code, ese, on my best day
I'm like God with the flow, bless me

[Pre-Chorus: Rell]
Baby, why are you chasing that man?
Knowing that he can't, love you like I can
I guess you'd rather chase, instead of feeling what's real inside
I got to thinking, and I hope you realize

[Chorus: Rell]
All this love for free
Better come and get it soon (Hurry hurry)
Please, don't take too long (I want your love babe)
Before it's all gone, I just wanna put you on

[Verse 2: Rell]
The apple of my eye, sweet cherry surprise
Let me up inside, of your body tonight
There's so much that we can do, me
And I'll do you, know how much I wanna
Taste your loving, so good

[Chorus: Rell]
All this love for free
Better come and get it soon (Hurry hurry)
Please, don't take too long (I want your love babe)
Before it's all gone, I just wanna put you on

[Bridge: Rell]
Hurry hurry hurry, hurry baby 'cause I can't wait
Hurry hurry hurry, 'cause later on might be too late (Gotta hurry)
Hurry hurry hurry, tell me whatcha gonna do
Hurry hurry hurry, there's too many dimes for me to choose

[Verse 3: Rell]
Baby you got me (got me going)
Going round in circles (tell me why)
And I can't explain why (I need your love)
Can't get enough of your love

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Yeah yeah yeah
In the SL with Rell, music at a high decimal
Mami fronting, touching buttons like she spec-ial
'Cause she sex well, and the best tail, Roc-A-Fella cartel
Excel-ing like Hyundai, Sunday to Sunday
It's for the nachos, come out the clothes
And baby girl if it's Hammer time then hide your toes
The game cold like, five below, but once inside the show
We tore it down; about that money, we throw it around
So when the ice hit the sun rays, run for shade
Game's over, we didn't come to play
The fuck y'all thinking?

[Outro: Rell]
Round and round in circles
(Tell me why) I can't explain why
(I need your love) Can't get enough of your love
Baby I've got all this love (all this love for free)
(Better come and get it soon) Baby baby baby
(Please don't take too long) I want your love babe
(Before it's all gone, I just wanna put you on)
Can you feel me growing baby
(All this love for free... Better come and get it soon...)

Ha ha, ha ha, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Futuristic shit, bee-atch
Uh, what the fuck? How we do, how we do
Uh huh, uh huh

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
It's the eventual triple platinum nigga with the solid gold fade
All that nickle and dime shit, don't hold no weight
Fortune 5, top 5 in the Forbes (you'll see)
As you thumb through The Source, I read the Robb Report
Class C, cold me down with the plastic
That's all I ask of you, like Raphael Saadiq
At the Hotel Nikko, Robert Duvall suite
My people's eyes through the peep hole
I'm loving you down freak, as I
Shoot through the city like a rumor
Not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreading
The newspaper heading read ""Jay-Z breathes, 80 degrees
Only thing to cool him off is a Malibu Bay Breeze""
Can't stop for the Feds, say cheese
You know they wanna take a nigga picture
Pray for the day to get ya, but I'ma parlay, stay richer for now
Jigga hasn't done dirt in a while
You know my stomach's getting weak from living life on the streets
For real, I'm trying to oversee it from suites, ordering eats
At the top where the real criminal minds meet
That's where the cream is (right?!)
That's where your dream is (well ain't it?)

[Chorus: Jay-Z, LL Cool J & Mary J. Blige]
You're only a customer (uh)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Irv Gotti]
Yeah, ayo my youth had a nigga too aggressive, ha
I used to speed excessive, both eyes closed
No thought infested
Hitting pot holes, cop-o's'll snatch your away
What you deem most precious
Had to rethink things, is pinky rings worth
Life on the run and time served in Sing Sing?
I don't know to tell the truth, if I'm pressed for dough
Gotta consult Irv Gotti y'all, heads got to roll
I was raised to live, Lord I pray you forgive
If not, I just handle it like Jason Kidd
What you're facing is official (it's official)
In most cases when I'm blazing won't miss you (won't miss you)
Case and point made bullshit a issue, I see it to the end
My writing so personal, my heart bleeding through the pen
Make no mistake about me
It's only one nigga living, I got half a cake about me
I got love, I can kill a friend over fam not drugs
And very, few people understand that love
To make a nigga die bleeding is nothing (nothing)
You make a motherfucker die breathing
Then you saying something, beeotch

[Chorus: Jay-Z, LL Cool J & Mary J. Blige]
You're only a customer (uh)
Walkin' in the presence of hustlers
We spend money all night, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha

You're only a customer (uh)

Roc-A-Fella...
More flavor than y'all can image having
Graphic like Sega Saturn, traffic like the Bodega
It just so happens, you caught me at the the tail end of my dirt
Brain ain't right from inhaling the work all my life
Fuck it, greasy I, had the whole D.C. high
Pissy off Cristal, 3G high
Seasoned Bacardi, VVS's
Blesses my body, we be fresh at the party
Play yourself go 'head if you don't know the ledge
It's like spitting to God
Get it in your face fucking with niggas over your head
Take your time with me, shifty
Used to make coke stretch like a sample in a 950
Shit with that, while I'm on a Kawasaki bike
At the light, doing a pike, with a bitch on the back
And take flight, my life like it was directed by Hype
In 35 slow-mo, with the Roc-A-Fella logo
Acapulco to Aruba, Bay Breezes and caviar beluga
Very little loot eludes us
In the grayish blueish L-e-x coupe
It's the root of evil in these people, what the fuck?

Niggas is dead! Dead, I tell you!
Can't be serious!
What you think's gon' happen with three of the illest niggas together, street music and so forth, on one track, huh?
Can't be serious!
It's Murda, nigga!
Huh! It's Murda!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
'Cause whether you're for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions
Everybody goes, everybody knows
The weapons I possess? They not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See, once I flash, motherfuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the...
Drive by to your hood, screaming ""bye-bye"" to you
Why would you fuck with me knowing I put you
Six feet deep and them niggas could die wit'cha?
Cock the hot pistol, then pop the hot pistol
And promise you only one thing: I will not miss you
Jay-Hova, know the God that served ya
'Cause dead or alive when I arrive, it's murda!

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Shit, I hope y'all niggas know to lay low now
'Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
'Cause I hit 'em on sight, its dark, dim the lights
You shot twice God bless to this the night
That a lot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right, be in hell looking for ice
Fucking with Ja, y'all bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick, y'all broke niggas making me rich
You gon' blaze me 'cause you high ripped off the Henny rock
Flow semi-hot, handling me you're not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, gravely ill
Niggas dying 'cause they know I spit like iron
Nothing but sparks flying, holes in mics
Hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seeing my plight, It's alright
I let the world know I shine like ice
I bet it all I can throw a hard four in the dice
'Cause I'm a gambling man
You should gamble with a gat in your hand
Spin in barrel and put it to your head
'Cause we don't dance no more all we do is cock and spit
Dedicated to giving y'all nothing but thug shit
Think we playing, you'll undoubtedly fall further
Fucking with I-N-C, it's murda!

[Verse 3: DMX]
I'm a cruddy nigga, going raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm giving that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like run it, niggas don't want it
Get it, done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, made it scraping
I made it fussing, busting, I made it capping
And letting off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, 'cause you's a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!
URRUURRRR! Let the dog loose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster than the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowing damn well that what I do is wrong
But still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so I gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructing
The blocks is not for fronting, so let me get that shorty
'Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, what you want, money, more?!
Them niggas did it raw, with no condom
You find 'em, saying sorry he for what he said before I blind him
Get the flame out the four fifth
And there ain't gonna be no more riff
Dog you on the floor stiff, would have made it to the door if
Bullets traveled a lot slower, and you ran a lot faster
But they don't and you can't so don't think about after
'Cause tomorrow ain't coming, so stop running
'Cause you gon' die like a sucker
Murder, motherfucker!

We the Diamonds, all you other players is coal
We the reapers of the rap game, snatchin your soul
Reb and Chink go together like Nike Airs and soles
Like platinum and gold, like we clap, and you fold
Nigga, hold up, shorties wanna roll once they swoll up
Babyface, but still grown up, I got it sewn up
Once you see the cars pull up, cigars rolled up
Henny to be throw up, stop playa-hatin, grow up
It's our world, your girl is now our girl
Without a question
I love the doe, that's my life confession

Out to stack chips in black whips to keep my money flowin
So the hoes can keep hoein and the doe can keep flowin
And the rock can keep rollin and the bread can keep foldin
Only talk to hoes that's swollen, like Eddie Murphy Reb's the chosen
For player-haters members in my staff be holdin
Diamonds gon' shine, hell yeah, I'm glad y'all noticed
Y'all don't want no parts of me, Chink, take it over

Chinky the soldier, told ya Diamonds takin over
Y'all can play hardrocks, but we bold as money-folders
With the world on my shoulders I struggle to get mine
Cause this crime in time may have me shine
If not, I'ma die tryin, relyin on myself to make it happen
While foes yappin, assisted is better
Long as it's the winning team, I don't care who's captain
I'ma be stackin and mackin and actin, what?

It's the thought of a ride that make my eyes wide, I'm caught up
I'm tryna make all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta
Say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow
I found a new route, you 'bout to see my life change
I make the means justify the ends
I make the cream, materialize keys to a Benz
And so I'm rollin'
For now, holdin' down the fort, who's controllin'?
The ground's gotta blow 'em, yep, y'all shoulda told 'em
Uhh, my first felony's approachin'
Copped my first key, took a freeze, now I'm frozen
I bought a black MAC, I'm outta control
Losin' bankrolls on blackjack, you gotta know
It always crossed my mind
That Feds be tappin' the lines like Gregory Hines
Still on the phone, discussin' my biz like it could never be mines
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life, uh

Baby, pimped out, I'm gettin' too large and smokin' cigars

Wasn't checkin' for me a dozen or so, months ago
Now I'm all they know, I'm a person (yeah)
Lettin' the Cristal's breathe at the Barnacle Bar
Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's

Uhh, give me a rush like you wouldn't believe
My head's about to bust, acceleratin' what drives me
Hope I don't gotta die to see, see, I can't lie to me

Sports cars, the good life'll give you a belly
But that's cool, as I zone in the Al Capone, watch me
'Cause the Medusa's head on Versace turned me to stone
Now my poems just ain't poems, they bloody when I recite 'em
Bones get disconnected like the phones
Now, I'm a hardened criminal with game
Like the Garden, all my penpals life controlled by the warden
Still the thrill makes me blind to the fact
I could do real time, I'm a prisoner of my crimes
Know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Now I'm incarcerated for my life

Yo I floss now, look how much my jewels cost now

So both sides is hate so it's mutual
Beautiful, my guns make it shoot-able
Shoot at you send staff to clap you
Yo my name's Nore but only fam calls me Papi

It's like niggas never learn, money to burn
Yo I'm leavin' like me and Nat' shit (I'm leavin'!!) let me say this
I used to rock to G-U-E with the SS
Now I'm in the '98 black GS
Golden with kid in my shit, on some full grits headlights
Shit shine from Def Jam to Crown Heights
Now my clique keep guns, time to fight
Open the flip on the Startac and check the message
Copped ten Sprint phones and caught a deal
What, one and the same, like Thugged Out and Ill Will

It's all real, still from Iraq...",

[Verse 1: Lil Fame]
We brought a very raw chapter, from the history of slinging crack
To the history of rap!
From the history, of street misery
The Brownsville, Brooklyn, Vietnamese
William and Womack, pa
It's known that you get your shit blown back, pa
The Hill is still real, we own that, pa
(Cock back the chrome) cause you don't clap, pa
What it look like, when they on the pipe?
Slinging the things that Fame getting cream all night
(Gotta get my hustle on) Go 'head
Cause I know what it be like, when you got no bread
When you down and out, people turn they back at you
Even the chicas try to disrespect the rapper due
I got gratitude, baby I ain't mad at you
I bet you that pussy is stink as your attitude
Hold that down, as I step off, no frown
Keep that Grinnage smile, like always
Some people getting fucked up in these raw days
But they can be left to stretch in they hallways
I got family from CI to B'ville
We fear no EVIL, bitch nigga, we real
(Now slide!) Slide
Before I turn this conversation, into a motherfucking homicide

Now I don't know if you remember me, it's (William Berkowitz)
From downtown swingin and slinging is no shit
Watch these real niggas, move crowds
While you pathetic, synthetic ass niggas ain't allowed
I'm not a gangster, and I won't lie
I've always been afraid to die
(So when worst come to worst) I'll back my shit out first
I'll feel better in an El Dorado, than in a hearse
When it;s TIME TO ROLL you know where them thugs at
(First Family!) , you know where my love's at
Give up to my peers who survived through the Blood, Sweat, and Tears
Here to a hundred years
We won't change or switch or aim or pitch!
We dedicated to dominating the same shit
(Holla-holler!) I know what I may have to do
(You know my motto!) Walk past and splash your crew
If I'm after you, it's on
Keep your head up, cause I won't let up till your ass is gone

[Verse 3: Lil Fame & Billy Danze]
Can I hear silence, for the peeps that's deceased...?
REST IN PEACE!
Y'all (Y'all), still with me
And I still keep that 45th with me
I'm dedicated to the game
Whether it's the streets or this rap thing
I'm gon' maintain a Brooklyn pugalier
I'm the judge (What?!), jury (What?!), and the executioner!
I'm used to the automatic machines
(The heavy calibre) And the bloody crime scenes
You know my name, I've been trained to flip
From the environment where they be firing whole clips
So tell your man stop flinchin'
Stand at attention, and prepare for the lynchin
(Firing Squad) With the same task

What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker
You a punk, I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatchin', jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or somethin'

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see 'em, try to be 'em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder
Locked rap for three summers, poker faces with the aces under
Phase one of the takeover, the break's over
Nigga, I'm the God MC—me—Jay-Hova
Shit knockin', almost a crime, get Cochran
Bangin' to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They wanna see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros

[Verse 2: Wais P]
We celebrate this, while you sittin' back screamin' you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spittin' sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just givin' face lifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heatin' the spot up like global warmin'
Who start *shit*? My style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you wanna see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in Hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazin in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm Resident Evil, movin' like (?)

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
Millionaire that flow like water, rap *niggas* runnin'
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the MAC at ya, *niggas* caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't *fuck* widdit
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets, TECs, honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was lookin' you found us
Movin' with speed, tried to play Superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaohs of Egypt
Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it
Keepin' my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16's
Bulgin' out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holdin', share these shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it...

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screwface in forty-two ways
Aim better than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire
""Show Me The Money"" like Clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zonin'
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foamin'
White sheets got ya wrapped like a Roman
Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
*Niggas* is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seekin', grill huntin', still frontin'?
Keep squeezin', *fuck it*, I leave the whole street wheezin'
No *motherfuckers* hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got 'em scared to drop like soap in jail

Never disrespect this thing of ours

[Intro: Pain In Da Ass]
Somebody's pulling me closer to the ground
I ain't panicked, I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who, and what was what
Man look at these suckers
I ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler
It just so happens that I know how to rap
OKAY, I'M RELOADED!

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
A million

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Uh-huh, I've did it again niggas
Fucked up, right? Ha, I know
I know what y'all niggas asking yourself
Is he gon' ever fall off?
No...

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
... A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honies I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck
But only a single goin' gold?
If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O?
For the millionth time, asking me questions
Like Wendy Williams, harassing me
Then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve
Ugh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?
What you doin in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses?
Latinos and Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico
I'll answer all your questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is, ""How bad you wanna know?""
BLAOW!

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
A million

Roc-A-Fella y'all, uhh, uh
Know my style

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
'Til I'm no more, 'cause I'm so raw
My flow expose holes that they find in yours
Wasn't for me, niggas still be dying for whores
But I hate when a nigga sit back, admiring yours
Young blood, you better get that, we frying because
Niggas don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse
And don't listen to the rappers yo, they dying to floss
I used to be O.T., applyin' the force
Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss
Come back with the clique playing Diana Ross
I'm the boss and this is how it's gon' be
Burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V
I got mouths to feed 'til they put flowers on me
And kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise
Tombstone read, ""He was holdin' no leaks""
Started from the crack game and then so sweet
Freaked it to the rap game, Jigga the O.G
On MTV, telling 'em how I sold D
And used to bag work up out of apartment 4-B
Me and my homie, started out co-d's
Picked the mailbox lock 'cause I ain't have no key
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'
Then I went low key, but now I'm back, it's on

What the deal, playboy? Just rest your soul
I be holding it down yo, still love the dough
Got these ladies on the cock, now you know how we go
Got the whole world on lock down, you know how we flow
Don't worry about Brooklyn, I continue to flame
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
You held it down long enough, let me take those reigns
And just like your spirit, the Commission remains
Niggas can cross the T's and, dots the I's
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm taking this rap shit serious, to my demise
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise
Basics in the basement, wasted
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit
My hatred is, fueled just give me a sign
And I let the world know that the city is mine, what?

You belong to the city (the city is mine, what-what-what)

Y'all wanna know how I flow just seek and you find
I'm like a brain in the voice box, I speak my mind
About to redefine rap mami, either I'm
The illest nigga doing it or these niggas is losing it
I read a article that said I was ruining shit
But every time I look, I'm moving units in quick
So I'ma hit y'all, with these last two and split
And leave niggas with nothing but my influences-es
Students of Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit
Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit
I'm the type to buy a Rollie and just ice my shit
On the spot, fuck coming back twice to shit
How real is that? My floss game, still intact
Boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that
Like the first dude to cop the 850 in '89
And drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what?

You belong to the city (the city is mine)
You belong to the night (yeah, uhh, the city is mine)

I snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough
Plus y'all don't stay in the studio long enough
I make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks
Had it locked 'til I came in the club, Take 6
Got your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent
Got her a Chinese manicure, hair done by Dominicans, all for what
So I could be in a dark corner, all in her butt
At the bar alchoholing her up
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
A buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name
I ain't a player, get it right, I'm controlling the game
From now until they blow holes in my frame
I'ma stand firm, holding my aim, feel me?
I'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime
On the low though - shhhhh, the city is mine!

You belong to the city (uh-huh, yeah, the city is mine)
You belong to the night (ah ah, the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (feel me, the city is mine)

Right, right
Yo, peep the scripts, scoped honey from the whip
Jumped out like ""YO! Who the fuck you with?""
Flash the jewels 'cause that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes
Face natural - can I get at you?
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
I didn't know how many niggas was humping hon
I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So I'm hoping you different, let you push the 6 and
Give you a different life and baby if it's right
Jump on it in the morning and ride it 'til the night
Want to buy you real jewelry when it hits the light
Bitches'll momentarily lose they sight

You want a cutie with a booty like POW!
Deeper than a MILE! Earrings shine like TADOW!
But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens - Get it?
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet
Marble faucets and matching Rolls Royces
In the driveway from Monday to Friday
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches
While chickens cluck giving up the butt
I plays the cut with the Daddy Warbucks
You can call me a slut, who gives a fuck
That's fine nigga shit, I'm good with mine
I can tell by your shoes you know what I want
Fuck a pre-nup give me half up front
My sex be the best so we split these costs
You can stop saying mine
And start saying ours

[Chorus: Puff Daddy & Lil' Kim]
I know what girls like, I'm a flyyyy girl
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what girls like, girls like me

They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what boys like, boys like me

Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze
Victoria Secret lingerie, ice like Don King
The price was like eight digits a long way, shit
Got the beachfront view, V1 too
Cop you one, cop me one too
On the place, jet ski's park by the lake
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make
Invite your friends over
Let 'em make their way through the Benzes and the Rovers
Before they reach the door
Vacate, away a week or more
First class to and fro, freaking off
Got to have things locked, champagne popped
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop
Cop Rembrandt, hang 'em, pay the lot
Can't complain, we balling, true or not ma?

You got flash now, but time will reveal money
I spit the hottest shit, you need it I got it shit
That down-South, Master P, Bout It Bout It shit
I got blood money, straight up thug money
That brown paper bag under your mattress drug money

Those ain't Rolex diamonds, what the fuck you done to that?
Y'all rapping-ass niggas, y'all funny to me
You're selling records being you, but still you wanna be me
I guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me
And still you running around thinking you got something on me
But I done did it
And y'all want to take my flow, and run with it
That's cool, I was the first one with it

Niggas kept complaining so I copped more diamonds
Rock more Versace, ain't nothing sweet
I still throw t'ree in your body, fleeing the party
Y'all can't go with me, nope, flow with me
Bet 50, not dollars either I brought some dough with me

[Intro]
Uh-huh uh huh uh, gee-gee-geyeah
Peeping, watching, streets
You boys are soft like bread
Uh-huh uh huh uh, live from Brooklyn
Uh-huh uh, the streets is watching
Check it, check, uh-huh uh, check

[Verse 1]
Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
But if you shoot me, then you're famous, what's a nigga to do?
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it
Beef assorted like Godiva chocolates
Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
Y'all niggas ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas tryna do
Is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John Meneilly
The type to start a beef then run to the cops
When I see you in the street got one in the drop
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
Taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop
The streets is watching

[Chorus]
When the, streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it

[Verse 2]
Now it's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill
The streets is watching you when you froze your arms
Niggas wanna test you when your gun goes warm
Can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up
Sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter
Once you're tagged lame, the game is follow the leader
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer
Kidnap niggas wanna steal you
Broke niggas want no cash, they just wanna kill ya
For the name, niggas don't know the rules
Disrespecting the game, want you to blow your cool
Force your hand, of course that man's plotting
Smarten up, the streets is watching (it's on)

[Chorus]
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake, can't ignore it

[Verse 3]
My street mentality: flip bricks forever, know me and money
We like armed co-defendants, nigga we stick together
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
Hustle harder 'til secret indictment time came around
Now you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found
Put in 24 hour shifts but, that ain't me now
Got a face too easy to trace, niggas mouths got slow leaks
Had to hire a team of workers, couldn't play those streets
See out of space like Mercury, you jerking me? Hectic
Had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message
It said this, 'Let's play fair and we can stay here
I'm trying to transform you boys to men like daycare'
Ay there's money to be made and, niggas got the picture
Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer
Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff had warrants
The other half in the casket lay dormant
I felt like life was cheating me
For the first time in my life I was getting money but it was like my conscience was eating me
Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that
I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back?
Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad?
Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack?
Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack
And not collide like two trains that's on the same track
But, get my life together like the oils I bring back
In the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
Got my transporter take it across the border then stop
To set up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan
For three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block
But you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes
One drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops
And this unstable way of living just, had to stop
Half of my niggas got time, we done real things
By '94 became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes
Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit
The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
I figured, ""shit, why risk myself I just write it in rhymes
And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine?""
The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate
So high in one city they send National Guards to get me
Shit, bitch, who's fucking with that? The streets",83.3K

Uh-huh uh, the saga continues...
Motion picture shit

[Verse]
I'm done talking
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Son soaking, sweating in his bed like dun' loc'in!
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a Vulcan
I swear I saw a light bulb when
He finally realized who was the culprit
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more
Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun - lay down
This time you're really going to listen to Jay now
I try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize
I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be
Plus I had sympathy when we all bought rims with your keys
And it was an afterthought that maybe you'll try to avenge me
But I was like ""Nah"", Homes had to know he was wrong
And if you caught me on the foul now you sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And that's really no fun
And here I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
But my mind's like a flower in bloom
Peep how my eyes just scour the room
I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out
You think you the first nigga I played out, in a two-hotel town?
Come on now, I peeped your Lexus as you
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
Money well invested, rudely interrupted
Jamaican accent (Boy you know who you dun fucked with?)
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?
I'm done talking, back up and clap him, one in the abdomen
Do me a favor duke, get two ice cubes I pass them
Take that ice up, for the nicest MC
And please yo, tell BIG, he's unbelievable
Friend or foe BIOTCH!",29.2K
"In My Lifetime, Vol. 1",Lucky Me Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-lucky-me-lyrics,"[Intro: Jay-Z]
How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong, nahmean?
How can a muh'fucka go round and hate a nigga
He never even met that, he don't even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Y'all don't even know every day I'm living with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor, hot-ass vest
You think I'm freaking these chicks, right?
I try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor dripping tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars, lucky me

[Chorus: Karen Anderson]
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I hate all girls with ulterior motives
That's why I'm 20+ years old, no sons, no daughters
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
Hear the hate in my voice, right? I hate that you noticed
Niggas wanna strip you to the bone for shit you own
Hate a nigga like that, faggot, get your own
Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome
Knowing one day I'ma have to flip, c'mon
You know the shit don't stop 'til the Cris' don't pop
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock
I'm trapped, the whole world's against me in fact
But ain't no turning back, bring it on
Hate the price of fame 'cause it cost too much
Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
Steady looking for flaws through us, lucky me

[Chorus: Karen Anderson (Jay-Z)]
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see
(Since I was 4 years old
I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold)
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(And now that I've arrived
I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
And niggas see you in the street, pretend to be friendly
But I know any type of success breeds envy
I know in the back of your mind you're conjuring ways to hem me
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny
But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive
Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up
And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up
Don't grieve for me, my art remains
Like a dart from the speaker to your heart
Spiritually through the portal now my words is immortal
Don't plan to leave without a fight, I plant a seed I give life
Though I can't see past the girl's greed to call her wife
Next time you're thinking heist better be precise
'Cause I'm fully prepared, one of us is gon' leave here
I have no regrets even though I won't see grow
My godson Boogie, Sonny and Remo, lucky me

[Chorus: Karen Anderson (Jay-Z)]
You only know what you see
(I been told, since I was 4 years old
Everything that glitters ain't gold
And now that I've arrived)
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold
Since I was 4 years old)
You only know what you see
(I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold
And now that I've arrived)
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold)
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me",70.1K

The G, Roc-A-Fella y'all

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi
Drinking sake, it's me, and my mami with the doobie
Cutie, smelling like Miyake, half-Philippine thing
For now, let's call her Suki, got me, this booty banging
Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy
Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ
Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry, watch me
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
'Cause who's getting played is not me
""Surely you jest,"" she said, ""if you thought I was purely
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me""
I said maturely, ""You right
But better safe than sorry, before the lovebirds
Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine""

[Chorus: Babyface (Jay-Z)]
Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z (Foxy Brown)]
A year gone, and she seeing things most chicks only
Hear in songs (uh-huh), keep in gear phenom
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)
Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown (Jay-Z)]
I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing
Hating 'cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you acting like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double cross you they got to triple cross me
(I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh
(One more thing:
If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'
(She replied, eyes open wide) Uhhhh
(Put that on everything?) I put that on my life
(Right)

Touch me with, a smile of gold (uhh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)

[Verse 4: Jay-Z (Foxy Brown)]
If I needed would you, give me your kidneys? (Uhh, uhh, fo' sho')
Catch a case, you catch it with me? (Mmm, fo' sho')
Pawn your jewelry to come get me? (You better know)
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (Uhh, now that, I don't know)
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)
They try to frame me, will you be there, 'til the truth prevail? (uhh)
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
That you was, throwin' rocks, on the roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shall, 'til the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you balling, from the Heavens, or the Hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling myself
Now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine
Just continue to be my sunshine, uhh

Yeah, peep the repertoire

Never sprung huh? Know my style

[Verse 1]
I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches
Rough bitches, don't matter you my bitches
Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches
Can't knock your hustle for real, it's a'ight bitches
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum french frames
With the french name in the same night
Pull you and your tight friend
Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R
Sexin' in a Lexus car
Match wits with the best of y'all, the rest of y'all
Is like vege-tables in my presence, check it
Reminiscin' to nothin' you ever heard
Iceberg Slim baby, ride rims through the suburbs
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred
Get money like I'm down South, Wednesday the third, it's on

More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit

Can't scheme on 'em, Roc-A-Fella got a team on 'em
Chicks dream on him, trick cream on 'em
Lose it when dudes think it's just music
Lean on 'em, flash green on 'em and diamond rings on 'em
Sexin' around the way girls down to miras
I'm something every girl gotta have like Levi's
Chiquita, mi amor, see how raw
You can love me or hate me, either or
I'ma stay winnin', rock the custom drop Bentleys
Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil' Pennys
Can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave
Just as quick, Indian give, ha-hah
Now what I look like? Givin' a chick half my trap
Like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin' that
You be the same chick when you leave me
The bankbook and the credit cards
And take everything you came with (it's on)

Yeah, here's somethin' niggas gon' find, not at all funny
We takin' all ya bitches, takin' all ya money
Jay-Z rated A.G. baby that's All Good
I sink this ball in your hole, I'm Tiger Woods
If the money was the grass and your ass was a tee
When I hit it with this club love you comin' with me
Grip you right up under your ass, put your back on the wall
Kinda tipsy, seein' triple, so I'm fuckin' y'all
You remind me of this dream I had the night before
I'm kinda hopin' the condom break to have a reason to go raw
I'm playin', hit the showers, hit the money spot
Where all the models play and big money is dropped
Drop the top, let her feel the moonlight it entranced her
She jumped all in my seat like some private dancer
I tell you somethin' new, if you don't hop down off that
Butter soft shit with your shoes, I'ma step on the gas
She laughed, put her ass back in the proper place
She said, 'I played my cards right and look, I got the ace'
I told her *beatboxes*, 'slow down baby'
You dealin' with a baller, who, hold ground crazy, it's on

More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit?

I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit?
More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick

Get clothin' and big cheddar, hopin it gets better

In front of your building clockin', thought I was makin' a killin'
Right in front of your children, eight-ball in my side pocket

You can treat us like convicts, you know we got records
On the shelf and on the charts the double decker
The fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me
You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook?
I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways
So I can get paid, everyday
I see the same old shit, I see in the streets
I know you think I'm sellin' keys but I only sell beats
Dopefiend music, it's drug related
You can buy it on the corner, get a radio and play it
It always sounds better when you turn it up loud
Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about
I know these gay ass record labels keep fuckin' niggas
It's just like in the streets mane, how much you get?

We treat this rap shit just like, handlin' weight
What they want we give it to 'em, what they abandon we take
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake
Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake
When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state
Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
Let 'em test the product, give 'em a promo show
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
Then we drop a maxi single and charge 'em two for five
Ain't tryin' to, kill 'em at first just, buildin' clientele
So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale
But when demand grows it's time to expand yo
You don't want no garbage papi, it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho'

Uh huh, ge-ge ge-ge-geah
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah, (Brooklyn)
How real is, this?
How real is, this? (Brooklyn)
Uh-huh huh (Brooklyn)
Respect this here, check!

[Verse 1]
I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come
You and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams was slung, niggas vanish every summer
When the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets
So I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check
I'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much
And girls from the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much
So they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your word was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it
I'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about
Who's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas?
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all

[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 2]
I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas been praying to God so long that they atheist
Where you can't put your vest away
And say you'll wear it tomorrow
'Cause the day after we'll be saying
""Damn, I was just with him yesterday""
I'm a block away from hell
Not enough shots away from stray shells
An ounce away from a triple beam
Still using a hand-held weight scale
You're laughing, you know the place well
Where the liquor stores and the base dwell
And government? Fuck government! Niggas politick theyselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, God strike me
And I got a question:
Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know
One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know
The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 3]
Check, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, around the corner and down the street
From where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet
We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the street, twisted off leek
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether you're four-feet or Manute size, it always starts out with
Three dice and ""shoot the five""
Niggas thought they deuce was live, then I hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa, forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs
Before you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood
Where I'm from

[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

"In My Lifetime, Vol. 1",You Must Love Me Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-you-must-love-me-lyrics,"[Intro: Kelly Price (Jay-Z)]
Throughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh)
No matter what I've done (right)
You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah)
Through all things (yeah)
For that I am eternally grateful

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Since my date of birth bought you nothing but hurt
Play those video games, stole change from ya purse
Sat on the cold court bench 'til I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face, still you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me, ""Don't let 'em hold you back""
What I do? I turned around and I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that, still I'm drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now: you're not to blame
You was newly separated tryin' to escape ya world
And through my thirst I didn't help you I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody that created crack
Had me thinkin' the newest kicks and the latest gat
Still haven't apologized, so please play this back
While I try to come to terms with such a heinous act
You know in more than one way cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about how the funds once came
Then I ran across this memory and it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty from which one came
That's a savage, you're the reason
Why me and these beats make a marriage
Why I rhyme above average and I ain't shit
Glad you got yourself together, no thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
You must love me

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
You must love me...
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me
Ohh yeah

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
We used to fight every night but I never would suffer
Just smile, my big brother's tryna make me tougher
As we grew fussing and fighting continued
As I plundered through ya stuff and snuck ya clothes to school
Got intense, real intense as we got older
Never believed it would lead to be poppin' one in your shoulder
Where my rings? Knew you had it 'cause you took too long
As Mickey, Annie and the girl that bought it looked on
Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand told you step outside
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
Made our way down the steps
Maybe you thought it was just a threat
Or maybe ya life was just that crazy
And you was beggin' for death
Try to justify this in my young mind
But the adrenaline and my ego hurt combined
Drove me berserk, saw the devil in your eyes
High off more than weed
Confused, I just closed my young eyes and squeezed (gunshot)
What a sound! Opened my eyes just in time
To see ya stumbling to the ground
Damn, what the fuck I done now?
Runnin' around in a circle thinking I'm assed out
Hot gun burnin' my waist, ran straight to Jaz' house
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga
And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
Left the scene, how could I go out that way?
Still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day
You must love me

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
What after all the wrong I've done
You must love me...
I know you must
You must love me...

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Everything in my power and within my frame
To protect you from this life and keep you away from the game
But you was one of the few people that I can trust
And the fact of the matter I slang these pies for us
You put the pressure on me daily, rarely would you let it go
Was a thousand and one times I had to tell you no
But it was one of those days when nobody was around
And I needed emergency trip out of town
Searched my mental Rolodex for all the numbers I know
As you stared in my face asking me could you go
I agreed said send her everything'll go smooth
Just tell her what to do and everything'll go through
Strapped her body with them thangs as you boarded the plane
Couldn't explain the strange feeling that I caught in the vein
I'm thinking why would I send you when I knew it ain't right
I'm thinking what would make you sacrifice ya life
You must've love me

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
(""You must love me"" repeats in background)
After everything that I've done wrong
I know inside you must love me
I know that you love me
You showed me I know it
I know
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
I know you must love me
Oh yes you do
Inside I know it
You've always shown it
You love me yea yeah
Oh yeah
I know that you love me",100.2K
"In My Lifetime, Vol. 1",Wishing on a Star (Ft. Gwen Dickey) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-wishing-on-a-star-lyrics,"[Chorus: Gwen Dickey]
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Uh-huh uh, yeah
I remember y'all niggas
Used to slap box y'all niggas
And smack y'all up, y'all used to see stars
We play corners (?) shit

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin' a club
Throwin' a shot down, tryin' to stay above
Ground, another round-breakin' day in the club
Surrounded by my own thoughts, playin' a cut
Reminiscin' on days I ain't have a pot to piss in
No watch to glisten, no V's with hot systems
Missin' my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin' the hottest cars, movin' out with our moms and I'm

[Chorus: Gwen Dickey]
Wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Thoughts interrupted by this chicken that I used to cluck with
Back in the days when I was movin' much shit, ""What up chick?""
Maintainin', it's the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
I see you kept it movin', you see I kept improvin'
She nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin' it down
Knew the 'Streets was Watching', stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
She said, ""Damn, I just stopped to say hi.... bye""
I was too deep for you from day one
That's why we never had relations, continued in my own zone

[Chorus: Gwen Dickey (Jay-Z)]
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done (uh-huh)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older males, sneak and drink older champ-ale
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze, hopped out the Lee's Dungarees
Into the Hawaiian shorts, relyin' on sports
To take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B, used to rhyme with a brush
In the mirror, my siblings used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of y'all
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!

[Chorus: Gwen Dickey]
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people we ever greeted
And I'm hoping on all the days to come and days to go
And I'm hoping on days of loving you so
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a star, baby
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a star, whoa-oh
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
Wishing on a star, yes I am
To follow where you are, whoa-oh
Wishing on a star, oh baby, I'm
Wishing on a star to follow where you are, ohh-I'm
Wishing on a star, baby, to follow where you might be

[Skit: Pain In Da Ass]
Ah shit, okay, okay, alright
Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys
They said they got two keys for us, for openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday
You get the buy money then
Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money
Eh, pobrecito
JAY-Z's gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Bounce.. bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Check, check

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining (brrrr)
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running
Y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up

[Chorus 1: Mary J. Blige & Jay-Z]
I'm taking out this time (yeah, yeah, what)
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle

[Chorus 2: Mary J. Blige & Jay-Z]
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it? Good, me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!

[Chorus 1 + 2: Mary J. Blige]
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

You know how we do
Roc-A-Fella... forever...

You can catch me
Skatin' through your town, puttin' it down, y'all relatin'
No waitin', I'll make your block infrared hot: I'm like Satan
Y'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to
Hustle behind the wheel, tryin' to escape my trouble
Kids stop they greetin' me, I'm talking sweet to keys
Cursin' the very God that brought this grief to be
My life is based on sacrifices, jewels like Isis
And fools that think I slip, you fuck around
You get your guys hit, they built me to be filthy
On some I-do-or-die shit, for real
The price of leather's got me, deeper than ever and
Just think, winter's here, I'm tryin' to feel mink, nig-ga

[Chorus]
Politics as usual

[Verse 2]
I took my Frito to Tito in the district
Blessed me with some VS
Somethings I can live with: stop frontin'
And for the dough I raise, gotta get shit appraised
No disrespect to you, make sure your word is true
I'm takin' wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson
Have a major night off, that's clean money, the tax write-off
You ain't seen money in your life, when it
Comes to this cheese y'all like Three Blind Mice
I'm smokin' bros who pump Willie, I expose
The furthest you Chiles been is the Poconos
My portfolio reads: leads to Don Corleone, nigga please
10-year felon, heavy on the wrist, I faze yous
With the diamond flooded Jesus and blind your facials
For life... sharight, Jigga, I keep it tight, nig-ga

You feel my triumph never - feel my pain
I'm lyin' low in the leathers, I am, the best that's ever came
The game changes like my mind just ain't right
Rewind get this dough, I guess it ain't your night
Suckin' me in like a vacuum, I remember
Tellin' my family: ""I'll be back soon""; that was December
'85 and Jay-Z rise 10 years later
Got me wise still can't break my underworld ties
I wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot
Got matchin' VCR's, a huge Magnavox
Ten inch, green like spinach, pop wines that's vintage
It's a lot of big money in my sentence
Hittin' towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that
Chick baby one-two cat, yeah, I do that
Ain't no stoppin' the champagne from poppin'
The drawers from droppin', the law from watchin' - I hate 'em

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Rock on, Roc-A-Fella y'all
The saga continues (What the fuck?)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce?
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the uptown high block, he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin', this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said ""pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothin' but time
I had near brushes, not to mention
Three shots, close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ty-Ty
Down in Nevada, haha, poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
Partner, I'm still spendin' money from '88, what?

Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Geyeah, know what?
I'll make, you and your wack mans fold like bad hands
Roll like Monopoly, advance
You're coppin' me like white crystal
I gross the most at the end of the fiscal year than these niggas can wish to
The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the Presidential, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then, I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin' brilliant
I'll tell you half the story; the rest, you fill it in
Long as the villain win
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin'
J-A-Y hyphen, controllin', manipulatin'
I got a good life, man, pounds and pence
'Nough dollars make sense, while you ride the bench
Catch me swingin' for the fence
Dead presidents, ya know? Uh-huh

Haha, yeah (Haha) yeah, so be it
The Soviet, the Unified steady flow
You already know: you light, I'm heavy, roll heavy dough
Mic-macheted your flow
Your paper falls slow like confetti, mine's a steady grow, perico
Pay 580 for blow, better believe I have 1160 to show
My dough flip like Tae-Kwon
Jay-Z the icon, baby, you like Dom?
Maybe this Cristals'll change your life, huh? Roll with the winners
Heavy spinners like hit records: Roc-A-Fella
Don't get it corrected, this shit is perfected
From chips to chicks to strippin' a Lexus
Naked without your gun, we takin' everything you brung
We cakin', you niggas is fakin', we gettin' it done
Crime family, well-connected, Jay-Z
And you, fake thugs is unplugged like MTV
I empty three, take your treasure, my pleasure
Dead presidentials, politics as usual—BLAOW!

Reasonable Doubt,Feelin' It (Ft. Angela “Mecca” Scott) Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-feelin-it-lyrics,"[Produced by Ski Beatz]

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Ha ha, ha ha
What.. '96 and forever
Rok-A-Blok, Roc-A-Fella
Yeah, keep it realer than most
Marcy, Brooklyn... yeah

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point?

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Even if it ain't sunny, hey, I ain't complaining
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40, hydroplaning, what, shorty?
(Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining
Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it?

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning: me and the chick on the island and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man
It got me going, shit

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët...",266.1K
Reasonable Doubt,D'Evils Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-devils-lyrics,"[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Hook Samples: Snoop Dogg + Prodigy]
""Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?""
""Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body""
""Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?""
""Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me""
""Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?""
""Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body""
""Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?""
""I can't die, I can't die, I can't die""

[Verse 1]
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're sayin' too much
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right, it's wicked – that's life, I live it
Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

[Verse 2]
We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin'
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know she's wishin' we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be; in time
I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils

[Verse 3]
My flesh no nigga could test, my soul is possessed
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doin' sticks
Like, ""Homie, you don't know me
But the whole world owe me, strip!""
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off – Momma, forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'evils beatin' me down, boo
Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm givin' lead showers
Stop screamin', you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils

[Intro: Maria Davis]
Yo wassup everybody, this is Maria Davis, Mad Wednesdays, we here tonight to have a good time
(""Yo! Start the show! Start the show!"")
Wait a minute; I see my man over there, Jay-Z
Jay-Z, Dame Dash let me hear that lil tape of yours, and it's phat
Why don't you come up here and kick a lil freestyle
Put that champagne down, and kick a lil freestyle for me tonight

[Intro: Jay-Z & Audience]
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Y'all motherfuckers must've heard that Tribe Called Quest shit
Let's do it again!
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone... check this out

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Too much West Coast dick lickin'
And too many niggas on a mission, doin' your best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions
That you're just fish in a pool of sharks, nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a ho
I'ma call you a ho, too many bitches are shady
Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers
I been around this block too many times
Rocked too many rhymes, cocked too many nines, too
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together
'Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever
I don't follow any guidelines 'cause too many niggas ride mine
So I change styles every two rhymes

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Hah, what the fuck
That's 22 two's for y'all motherfuckers out there, nahmean?
Shall I continue? Check it out, what?

[Refrain: Jay-Z]
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone... yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Copped to reach my quota, push rock, roll up smooth like on ya
Whole groove like hold-up, swoll up
Too many faggot niggas clockin' my spendin'
Exercisin' your gay-like minds like Richard Simmons
If you could catch Jay right, on the late night
Without the eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right
I dip, spit quicker than you ever seen
Administer pain, next the minister's screamin' your name
At your wake as I peek in, look in your casket
Feelin' sarcastic, ""Look at him, still sleepin'""
You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty
Mine's thinkin' longevity until I'm seventy
Livin' heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?
Nigga you broke, what the fuck you going to tell me?

[Outro: Maria Davis]
Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a phat track (aight)
Now this is comin' on your new album, on Roc-A-Fella records in '96?
(No doubt, no doubt)
Well, it is definitely the bomb! But you know I do wanna say somethin' to you, I know you've been havin' a lot of problems with the law
But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%. Mad Wednesdays, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dame Dash, Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back any time!
(Hah, thanks a lot)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Ace, turn that music down. I smell some reefer, now you see? That's why, our people don't have anything, because we don't know how to go in places and act properly
(""Hey, shut the fuck up!"")
Wait a minute, wait a minute, who told me shut the eff up? Who told me to shut the eff up? Get him out of here! I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out! Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech!
Thank you, he's out of here now, now like I was sayin'... we gotta build our own businesses, we gotta get our own record companies goin' like Roc-A-Fella Records, we got this, put our own money in our businesses...",176.6K
Reasonable Doubt,Can I Live Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-can-i-live-lyrics,"[Produced by Irv Gotti]

[Intro]
Yeah, hah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to somethin' epic, you know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?

[Verse 1]
While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
""I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.""
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas

[Chorus]
Ge-ge-geyeahhh
Can I live?
Can I live?

[Verse 2]
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
""Let's do this,"" it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS — you see me stressed, right?

[Chorus]
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?

Fox Brown..
Yeah, Jay-Z, what
I keep it fresher than the next, bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You got your own '96 somethin' to ride
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends, you got to watch me, they connivin'
Shit, the first chance to crack the bank, they try me
All they get is 50 cent franks and papayas
From the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
Had more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon
So when I shoot, meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still poundin' in my afterlife
Laughin', my shit is tight, who you askin', right?

[Chorus: Foxy Brown & (Jaz-O) with Jay-Z]
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fresh to death in Mo-schi-no, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surroundin' your feet in Joan & David and Charles Jourdan
I keep you dove, but love
You know these hoes be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes, B, and so I creep
I've been sinnin' since you been playin' with Barbie and Ken and
You can't change a player's game in the 9th inning
The chrome rim spinnin' keeps them grinnin'
So I run way the fuck up in 'em
And wrinkle they face like linen
I play hard until they say ""God
He's keepin' it real, Jigga stay hard.""
Lord, don't even trip, shit, I never slip
Nigga, get a grip, what you don't see is what you get
Weapons concealed, what the fuck y'all feel
When you niggas play sick we can all get ill
Fox Brown.. (what the deal?)

Yo, ain't no stoppin' this, no lie
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But, love, you know these hoes be makin' me weak
Y'all know how it goes, B, so I stay deep

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
What up, boo? Just keep me laced in the illest snakes
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs
Mackin' this bitch, wifey nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember the days you was dead broke
But now you style and I raised you, basically made you
Into a don, flippin' weight, her-on and shit
You know the pussy is all that
That's why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabbana to H Bendel, I'm ringin' bells
So who the player? I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor-made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin'
On how I fuck the best and shit
Especially when I'm sippin' Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push the Z, eatin' shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit, when you was in leathers and bullshit Berettas
And E classes with Mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens is up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me, playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry about them other chicks
'Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spendin' that bitch
I took a little when you was up north, your commissary stay pilin'
How you livin' large on the island?
All them collects have me vexed, but when you come home
Knew I was comin' off with half of them checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami with the slanted eyes
Holdin' this grip, cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit
Fucks no, I see half of that dough
Made you into a star, pushin' hundred-thousand-dollar cars

Friend or foe, yo, state your biz
Ummm, you tendin' dough? Ah, there it is
Me, I run the show, oh, and these kids don't like nobody comin' around here fuckin' with they dough for shit
You enterprisin' though, and I like it
But fuck with the big dogs, yo, I gotta bite ya
Look, it's out of my hands
And you gettin' money 'round here, it's not in the plans
So hop yo' ass out of that van, head back to Kansas
I'm sendin' niggas back up in campuses
Chance is slimmer than that chick in Calvin Klein pants is
Let me guess, they said it was money 'round here
And the rest is me stoppin' you from gettin' it, correct?
Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel
I'll take care of that, you'll soon see
Now please give me the room key
You're twitchin', don't do that, you makin' me nervous
My crew, well, they do pack, them dudes is murderers
So please, would you put your hand back in sight?
They don't like to see me nervous, you can understand that, right?
You draw, better be Picasso—you know, the best
'Cause if this is not so, ah, God bless
You leave me no choice, I'll leave you no voice
Believe you me, son
I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done
Now calm your boys
'Cause I'm findin' it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise
Get the point, I'll let you go; before you leave
I guess I ought to let you know, I need those keys
And a promise you never, no matter the weather

Come experience... life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Place: Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions: well, y'all know the actions

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uhh, I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking
To honies hawking, I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle
Nobody want to be like Michael where I'm from
Just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace
Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight.. balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day
And chasing crackheads up the block for my pay
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level
Pushing Vettes through the 'jects
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibrium
And stunned, I'm waiting for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge
I don't want a lifetime sentence, just give me the word

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z and Memphis Bleek]
Hey fella I been watching you clocking
Who me? Holding down this block? It ain't nothing
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Hahah, I like your style (Nah, I like your style)
Let's drive around awhile! Cool, nigga
Here's a thou', A G? I ride with you for free
I want the long-term riches and bitches
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same
(On the low?) Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly (AND THEN YOU BLOW!)
Kid, keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards, then he through dealing I understand
Don't blow your dough on hotties
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break 'em for nobody
Hah, I like your résumé, pick a day, you can start
From now until death do us part, nigga (Right!)

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (and stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up ( and stick up my chest, and make some loot)

Reasonable Doubt,Cashmere Thoughts Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-cashmere-thoughts-lyrics,"[Intro]
Hah, hah, hah, hah, yeah, yeah
What it is player?
(You player, it's all about you
How you gon' say that man)
If I had your hand I'd turn mine in
(Far as I'm concerned, if I had your hand, I cut mines off)
Hah man, you know man, I'm just dealing that hoe money
You know hoe money is slow money but it's sho' money
(Check this out man, you run up on your bitches
This is what you tell 'em
Stick they hands in they panties, grab that knot
Stick they arm in a car window, drop it like it's hot)

[Verse 1]
Uhh, I talk jewels and spit diamonds: all cherry
Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga - Jay-Z, lethal drugs
18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rapping them through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
'Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
Yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wine down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate, with this rich nigga rhetoric
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know
From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, Now
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Focus on the loc', I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi, from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
Yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick hard

[Interlude]
Whoooh! (That's cashmere baby)
Nah, you know, that's just laid back man
(Man, shit, J to the A to the Y to the Z)
Cashmere baby
(Motherfucking pimp that's what he be)
Cashmere baby
(It don't get no hotter than that baby)
Sho' yo right, sho' yo right
(Them niggas know)

[Verse 2]
Check it out, check it out
Ghetto's Errol Flynn, hot like heroin
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your borough and
I gotta keep your tricks intact
'Cause I walk like a p-iy-imp, talk like a mack, man
The star player, the golden bar layer
The sweet Ms. Fine Thing puh-layah, sho' yo right
I'm game tight, so why should it change tonight?
Go tell your peeps dog I'm lethal until it ain't right
I pimp hard on a trick: look
Fuck if your leg broke bitch, hop up on your good foot...",86.4K

Yo, you got the money, man? You ass bettin' ass, nigga

I'ma get the shit before we go downstairs
Yeah, aight, what's up with that case, man?
Aw, man, it ain't nothin
Ain't nobody snitchin or nothin; you know our team is tight
Still sittin on seven digits, unlike you, you broke ass nigga

[Intro: Sauce Money]
Ayo, Jay, word up
These motherfuckers fucking talking
That comeback shit like they cooking crack
Shit, I ain't fronting
All I want my pockets green like slum change
You know what I'm saying?
Front the roll we roll back like rubbers, motherfucker, for real
With no trace of AIDS
We keep our pockets fully blown
Roc-A-Fella clique, nigga

[Verse 1: Sauce Money]
Ayo, we patting down pussy from Sugar Hill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing
You cling, we do our thing and bring
Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast host is hostile colossal
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles, huh
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Preemo, got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

[Chorus: Fat Joe sample]
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I cream, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on end
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live, did dough with my nigs, dividends flow
Like the Mississippi Riv', looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fondle trigger straight up, shoot my guns
Horizontal, get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds
You're barely a hundred and twenty five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?

[Chorus: Fat Joe sample]
Bring it on if you think you can hang

[Verse 3: Big Jaz]
Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvergnügen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness mañana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

[Chorus: Fat Joe sample]
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang

Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang

Reasonable Doubt,Regrets Lyrics,https://genius.com/Jay-z-regrets-lyrics,"[Intro]
Stress...
Sunshine, shade, geyeah

[Verse 1]
I sold it all, from crack to opium
In third person, I don't wanna see 'em
So I'm rehearsin' with my peoples how to G 'em
From a remote location in the BM
Scopin' the whole situation, like, ""Damn!""
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em
The windows to his soul were half closed, I put the key in
Pulled off slow, hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars
Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time/Warner
Awaitin' a call, from his kin, not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets?
(This time, stress, givin' this shit up, fuck)

[Chorus 1]
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

[Verse 2]
As sure as this Earth is turnin', souls burnin'
In search of higher learnin'
Turnin' in every direction, seekin' direction
My mom's cryin', because her insides are dyin'
Her son tryin' her patience, keep her heart racin'
A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit
But it's this game Love, I'm caught up all in it
They make it, so you can't prevent it, never give it
You gotta take it, can't fake it, I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shakin'
'Cause I sense danger like Camp Crystal Lake and
Don't wanna shoot him, but I got him
Trapped, within this infrared dot
About to hot him and hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions, no time, shit's stressin'
My life found I got to live for the right now
Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
Once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets

[Chorus 2]
You used to hold me, told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
(When I was young) you used to hold me
Told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

[Verse 3]
I found myself reminiscin', remember this one?
When he was here he was crazy nice with his, son
I miss him, long as I'm livin' he's livin' through memories
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In heaven lookin' over me, or in hell keepin' it cozy
I'm comin', life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
Remember Newton, mutual friend?
Well, me and him feudin', on your life I tried to talk to him
But you know niggas, think they guns can stop four niggas
Frontin' like they're Big Willie but really owe niggas
Hoe niggas, this year I'll show niggas — think I'm slippin'?
I'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshittin'
But my hustle's goin' too well to hit him
You was right, niggas want you to be miserable with them
Anyway, I ain't tryin' to hear it, I think I'm touched
This whole verse I been talkin' to your spirit a little too much

[Chorus 1]
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

('Cause you can't knock the hustle...)
Ohh, uuuuuuahyeah, uuuuuuooooooh
Foooooool's, paradise
(Jay-Z, ha ha, Meli'sa Morgan)
You better think twice
(Roc-A-Fella y'all, it don't stop)
'Cause it's not very nice

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
We about to change this game dear
Check my pockets, ain't nothing but game there
I remain without peer, keep the lames clear
And the cats that's all about scratch remain here
On top of this Metropolis
My name's like a swear, dropped off every tier
Now y'all can swear to Jay
Heard it the other day
Through the missive, peep how they script it
We got to hear you every night 'fore we hit the lights, it's type addictive
Need cash to live with, the beat goes on
Every day is a hustle, the heat grows on
Funny thing happens when years of chasing money unfolds
And the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old
Niggas stay low, like six-fours of shit and gold
And watch for hoes with form fitting clothes
And I, hope you shine
Seen many wrinkles and enough memories to last you two lifetimes
Can't knock the hustle

[Chorus 1: Meli'sa Morgan (Jay-Z)]
I'm taking out this time (uh huh, uh huh)
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle, how we do)
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Check this
In a man's world need a girl to touch something
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something
If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something
When I get home, then it's on
Girl just crack your shaped legs like Grade A eggs
Love the way you behave and beg
Moans, turns to hollers and screams as we zone like a college team
Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens
Life with me, consists of a lot of things
Chicks in your ear, kicking dirt, 'cause you got hotter rings
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind them freak chicks, stay out my bizziness
Know they can't love it, trips to L.A. with no luggage
Came back with six bags struggling
In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me
Steak still warm on me

[Chorus 2: Meli'sa Morgan (Jay-Z)]
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy (uh huh)
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel (how we, how we do)
The way you're making me feel ('cause you can't knock the hustle)
I don't want no romance (uh huh), I just want the chance
Can't knock the hustle for real (ha)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Ever since I retired, working alongside of live wires
To this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars
I guess I'm biased 'cause what I talk about I live
These rap dudes conflicted
Some of them ain't even rapping for chips
What part of the game is this?
Seems brainless, on tours like whores, guess what I'm saying I miss
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques
Started with four jacks, ended up with gold Ac's
Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped
On their, way to me through you, screw you
Gun blew you, out of one then two shoes
Run through you like um, excuse you
But that's my cash, look, I understand your hustle
But that's my cash, you don't understand
Let my dough pass, you can show it love
Like a rap star in front of the club
But don't knock the hustle

[Chorus 1 & 2: Meli'sa Morgan (Jay-Z)]
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star (Jigga, Meli'sa)
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy (uh huh, ha ha)
'Cause that's the way you making me feel
The way you making me feel
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
I don't want no romance (how we do), I just want the chance (say what)
Can't knock the hustle for real

Yeah, is y'all niggas finished, yo?
Is y'all niggas finished?
Got your little radio play, your little BDS, huh
You finished nigga? Huh huh, y'all finished
Can I live, huh
Can I live, yo, you're being stingy with the fucking music again yo

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, yo... yo I blacks out, I pulls the MAC out
Scream ""what's that about?"", then I clap out
I get my plot on and my drop on, through the rotten
Don't even hate on those who hate me, I got Pac on
Feeling it (feeling it), chickens are ice grilling it
Cops pulling it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher, then return the devil's fire
I'm raised different, react in situations niggas lay stiff in
Rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows, create criminal odes
Sing along if y'all with me, 'til the end of the road
I'm cynical, when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand, is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?

[Refrain: Jay-Z]
Can I live, for all my niggas with all white Air Force Ones
And black guns, stack ones yo
Can I live, for all my chicks pigeon-toed
Stand bowlegged like a bulldog, know what I mean, huh?
Can I live, to all the cee-lo champs
Two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll, heads, yo
Can I live, to all my niggas who drink Hennessy straight
Cop mixtapes and sell weight, niggas

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I got the Feds sending me letters, 'cause I'm schooling the youth
But they can't lock me down, 'cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living, that's a given
Why is it? Why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods, I live in?
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you up more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeating itself
Ran into shorty bopping down the ave
On his way to clocking math then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
Ayo there's money out there I just got to have
When I catch up to these fiends I'ma knock 'em on they ass
Not to brag, sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not to grab
When I backed out, let one out, let the barrel turn
Holla at you faggots that it's my block to burn
That credit you dead it
I know heads getting annoyed and knew all
About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy and, using the right cut
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
This slab gotta re-up and re-bag
Blend it in with the raw, bubble it fast cop more
Once I get it I got it I lock it, nobody pop shit
Selling twenties on my block, bitch, on some blacktop shit
What you want nigga? What you want nigga?
What you want, what you want nigga?

Can I live...
To all my niggas that hold coke in they bubble coat
Trying to win with the construction Timbs yo

This song here is dedicated to Danny Dan, may he rest in peace
Who at his funeral left us with the words that
He did it his way (uh-huh, uh-huh)
So I have no other choice but to do it my way
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Uhh, while niggas are shootin' stupid, I'm carefully plottin'
Ways to make it rotten, well-planned hits until you're long forgotten
Y'all niggas that utilize my style don't hurt me
'Cause on the low half of these rappin' ass niggas wanna work for me
Now picture me standin' on somebody block tryin' to rock
I drop bombs and niggas see me with that dough by eight o'clock
My feet never touch the concrete, just street sweep awards
While you're starin' on my dick nigga, gimme yours
I don't hassle with capsules, cause that'll make the grass grow
And get a project nigga paid up the asshole
If I'ma risk a frisk, gettin' my wrists wrapped up in steel
I'm out here trying to make a mill', my shit is real for real
While others worship guns I worship tons of money
Tons of fun, laughin' at shit that ain't even funny
So I ain't pressed to make a CD, I took it slow
80% of these niggas with deals
Can't see me with the dough, uh

[Chorus]
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash

[Verse 2]
More ice than winter '94
I toured the 50 states with a trunk of raw
Recruitin', I'm hittin' shorties with consignment but don't play me
Oh, you gon' pay me, y'all niggas ain't crazy
I'm laid back in the five thousand Italian leather seat recliner
Under some vagina, discussin' the finer, things
My crib is mean, watchin' a hundred inch screen
Lettin' the shorties slide by once in a while and let 'em dream
They think I've mastered the game, cause dames scream my name
With passion, I tell 'em stop flashin' and start stashin'
And we'll all get off the corner, the only heat you'll feel
Is from a sauna, lettin' bubbles shoot up your ass if you wanna
And fuck that weed, it keeps you broke, invest in
Pounds of herbs and profit if niggas wanna smoke dope
But keep your nuts, 'cause this is a man's game
And we'll all pop champagne till it's a damn shame

[Chorus]
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash

[Verse 3]
I'm shootin' to Vegas, gamblin' green-o at the casino
Schoolin' the dice like Vinny Barberino
Welcome back, the '95 version of The Mack
As soon as these ladies see me they don't know how to act
'Cause like that, nigga, never twist the cap of malt liquor
Only pop and droppin' Cristal's down my throat, take a swigga
My style, ladies intoxicated by my profile
You're rollin' with a pro with, money to blow child
You need to feel how sweet the skills be
To come and slide down Sugar Hill with me
The high roller, rolled up on your dice game
Unfold a pack of bills, grab my balls then bet it all
I never slept, 'cause sleeping keeps you deep in debt
On the block you lucky if you see my silhouette
I'm ghost, envied by most
So I keep a crew of crazy tenants that's sling toast, fucker

[Chorus]
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
